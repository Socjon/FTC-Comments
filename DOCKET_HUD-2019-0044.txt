My Hispanic/Latino clients have less likelihood of becoming evicted or "cycling back through" our program because of how determined and grateful they are for the opportunity to have housing. They are hardworking and, on average, are employed at a much higher rate than my Caucasian OR African-American clients. They maintain their housing and employment. They pay more taxes than anyone in Washington, D.C. making these rules. They are deserving people and should not be "set out." Regardless of housing crises across the country, the procedure is the same -- "first come, first served" in regard to public housing.

The proposed rule will cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. A significant number of these families include individuals and children who trying to rebuild their lives after being seriously impacted by domestic violence.<br/><br/>I live in Los Angeles County and work for an agency that serves domestic violence survivors and their children, including providing these families with emergency shelter, transitional housing and access to affordable, safe long-term housing. I have personally witnessed how the ability to obtain federally-subsidized housing has improved the long-term stability of the families we serve and kept them from returning to an abusive situation.<br/><br/>Domestic violence survivors already face significant barriers to obtaining and maintaining housing after they leave an abusive relationship. These include economic instability and discrimination due to the violent acts of their abuser that often occur where the survivor lives. In fact, domestic violence is a primary factor that causes women to become homeless in our communities. The proposed rule creates another significant barrier for survivors who live in mixed-status families, which are common in our local community and throughout California. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of children in Los Angeles County, and nearly half of all children in California, live with foreign-born parents (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, Oct. 2017). Moreover, with half of all unsheltered Americans living in California, our state is also facing an unprecedented housing shortage and homelessness crisis. <br/><br/>The proposed rule forces low-income and vulnerable families to choose between breaking up their family and foregoing critical housing assistance, the loss of which could cause them to become homeless. The rule does nothing to help prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance, as the law already prohibits undocumented immigrants from accessing these subsidies. In fact, the list of ineligible immigrants under the proposed mixed-status rule includes people with legal immigration status, such as domestic violence survivors who were granted legal status after they cooperated with law enforcement in bringing their abuser to justice. <br/><br/>The only purpose served by the proposed rule is to increase fear among immigrant communities, unfairly penalize vulnerable families and children, and intensify an already critical housing and homelessness crisis in communities throughout our nation.

This is patently false- Public Housing Authorities do not, and never have, paid for the subsidized housing of ineligible immigrants, instead choosing to prorate the amount a family owes in rent based on the household size excluding the ineligible immigrant. This reasonable accommodation for families with ineligible immigrant status helps keep families together, provides children with connection to their culture, and can often facilitate American citizens to obtain and maintain their job through provision of childcare, advice, and skill development.

Do you understand the trauma you are inflicting on households that include resident children and adults of illegal status?  You are creating a tremendous amount of undue trauma that will follow these children for a lifetime.  The trauma alone will lead to poorer behavioral and physical health outcomes.  Trauma leads to substance abuse and addiction issues, mental health issues, and many physical health issues including heart disease. Left untreated, the behavioral health issues will lead to higher incidences of crime, leading to more time in prison and will also lead to misuse of emergency rooms.  All of these things cost way more than the subsidy you are providing.  If you do not care about the children, think about the funding you are throwing away.  Read the book, "The Deepest Well".  You will learn a lot, and it will hopefully help you reframe your decisions.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.

Having worked with residents in federally subsidized housing across a number of jurisdictions, I know how disruptive and damaging the proposed changes will be to families, children, and communities.  HUD is seeking to disrupt many families and place burdens on local communities, including already overburdened housing authorities in support of the current administrations anti-immigrant stance.  The actual effect of these policies will be to increase homelessness of families, particularly children who live in mixed status households.  And for what purpose?

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority currently assists 284 Mixed-Status Families. This number represents 561 adults and 461 children, for a total of 1022 potentially homeless individuals that would be forced out into the streets. Many of these families are composed of mostly eligible citizens or eligible non-citizen with one household member that does not have eligible status. Many area shelters do not allow families to stay together, forcing males and females to find separate shelter. It also forces male children ages 18 and up to be separated from their mothers when in many instances the mother is the only family they have. This rule would force the breakup of families and deny assistance to those household members who would otherwise be eligible. It would also force elderly and/or disabled families into homelessness. <br/>On behalf of the families that I serve and have served every day for the past 22 years, I beg you to reconsider this cruel and heartless rule. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

It makes no sense and it shows the egotistic side of those that have it and choose not to share it. As is, families are being separated once they try to come to this country and now that they in it, they too will be separated. All this will conclude with more homelessness. This is not a solution to homelessness, it is just another approach to attack illegal immigrants willing to work the agricultural fields and the many other jobs that many of us are not willing to break a sweat for (get paid pennies for).

Though HUDs expressed desire to address the national housing crisis and reduce public housing waitlists is commendable, the proposed rule would fail to address the actual drivers behind housing shortages and would instead threaten access to safe, affordable housing for tens of thousands.<br/><br/>For the reasons detailed within the attached comment, we strongly oppose the proposed changes and urge that HUD withdraw the rule in its entirety.

It would also increase the number of children living in poverty each year. <br/><br/>Families are squeezed by sky rocketing rents across the country and public housing is a necessary protection for them. By enacting these policies HUD will be directly harming families, making more people housing insecure, and guaranteeing that people die. Our national housing crisis must be addressed.

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>Here in New Jersey, there is a critical shortage of affordable housing.  HUD should fix the problem instead of pitting one group of families in need of housing assistance against another equally needy family.  It is incomprehensible that a country as wealthy as ours should arbitrarily limit the supply of public housing and Section 8 vouchers available to those in need.  Spending 717 billions of dollars this fiscal year on defense gives me no measure of security.  A fully funded HUD housing assistance budget would give me a great measure of security as my advanced age means that it is only a matter of time before I will have to move from my modest home which I own to an apartment.  I have looked at the economics of it.  I will not be able to long afford a market rate rental which would rapidly deplete any benefit I would gain by selling my house.  <br/><br/>Please fix the problem by appropriating more money; not by imposing cruel and unconscionable punishment on mixed immigrant families.  I will say this without apology.  What Trump and his administration is doing to immigrants and undocumented immigrants in particular echos the beginning of the persecution of the Jews in Europe by Hitler and his henchmen.  Relying on a history of disfavor to tone up the disparagement of a disfavored group and imposing punishing restrictions, led the way to the death camps.

All across the Nation, cities are fighting affordability crises. We feel it in Birmingham and residents are falling more quickly into homelessness when they can't pay their bills and are staying in homelessness longer because the housing market is so tight. HUD funded programs are a welcome release value to this pressure, and discontinuing service for mixed-status families will further pressurize the affordability climate and stifle homeless service systems that are already struggling to keep up with market and policy changes. In a time where more and more people are experiencing housing instability, we need more low barrier services and programs to help people gain stability quickly, not more barriers and regulations.

Further, extensive research illustrates the link between access to affordable, quality housing and health (e.g., housing insecurity, unsafe homes, exposure to indoor air pollutants, etc. can impact health in a number of ways). <br/>This proposed rule would force families of mixed immigration status to separate or face eviction. This rule will directly impact thousands of immigrant families' access to housing, leaving many of them at risk for homelessness. HUD's analysis indicates that more than 55,000 children, who are US citizens and are otherwise eligible to receive housing benefits, could face eviction under this proposed rule. <br/>The law already prohibits undocumented immigrants from accessing housing subsidies so this rule is unnecessary. <br/>Additionally, housing authorities and private property owners would have an administrative burden to comply with this new rule and would need to focus their resources on evicting families of mixed status. Imposing additional burdens may deter private property owners from participating in Section 8 programs, which would worsen the affordable housing crisis.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

It's revealing to see people, including Ben Carson, talking about the needs of low-income citizens; the children of the households who might lose their housing due to this rule change, ARE American citizens and deserve the same rights, respect, and care as any other American child.

My perspective is informed by my knowledge of organizations around the country who approach housing as a human right, in which all people should be able to access high-quality, safe, and affordable housing. The research I have worked on with a variety of partners shows that housing is an essential social determinant of health for adults and children alike, and organizations around the country work every day to keep families together by preserving, protecting and creating safe and affordable housing access. I am concerned that the proposed rule would diminish these efforts by separating families - or worse, putting children and others on the street and sleeping in vehicles. <br/><br/>Further, this rule is predicated on Executive Order 13828, Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility. The EO states that our country was founded on principles of freedom and equal opportunity towards self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility. Diminishing children and families access to a roof over their heads, separating families and evicting individuals and families all contradict these principles. <br/><br/>Housing stability for low-income residents is a vital social determinant of health and broader community economic stability. It is well-established that evictions are a health equity issue - increasing rates of evictions disproportionately impact Black women and their children. In addition, even the threat of eviction leads individuals to report poor health, high blood pressure, depression, anxiety and distress relative to people who experience stable housing. The results of evictions - including overcrowding, homelessness and emergency room visits - also demonstrate various negative health outcomes for adults and children.<br/><br/>Eviction and other forms of housing instability, such as having to move frequently, are particularly harmful for children, which means that these rule changes would harm the health of many children living in mixed-status families. Unstable housing means that children are more likely to have behavioral problems and to struggle in school  and in classrooms where the student population changes quickly and frequently, all students can fall behind. Education itself is linked to positive health outcomes and longer lives: thus, creating housing instability in childrens lives can have immediate and negative health impacts, but can also lead to poorer health across the lifecourse by disrupting their education.<br/><br/>When families have to put too much of their income towards their rent, they cannot afford to pay for other basic needs like food and health care. Hence, problems like food insecurity increase along with housing costs, and many renters delay needed medical care because they cant afford it.<br/><br/>Through its anticipated impact in terms of evictions, this proposal also violates basic just cause principles which have been codified by various cities and states - often as a result of concerted effort by housing justice advocates and partly in response to the fact that evictions have the greatest impact on low-income and Black residents.<br/><br/>Ripping families away from stable housing, or tearing families apart so that only some members can have a home while other do not, have severe and deadly public health outcomes - not just for the families, but for our society. We cannot have healthy, thriving communities by increasing separation and/or displacement and housing instability of low-income children and families. <br/><br/>Please see the attached research which I have co-authored that discusses the role of stable, appropriate housing in supporting children's sleep, related to both long-term physical and mental health. <br/><br/>Along with many others, I urge the Department to rescind this dangerous proposal which would leave families with no other choice but to either lose their homes or split up their family members. We ask that the Department instead promote policies that support access to high-quality, safe, and affordable housing as a human right.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I believe everyone deserves access to housing; it's an essential human right and no person should lose this right because of their immigration status, as it will only make it more difficult for them to lead a stable life. In New York City, where I live, we already have a homelessness crisis, and I worry that this policy will further tax an overwhelmed aid system. I'm also concerned about the many children, both citizens and immigrants, who will be affected. Will they be able to attend and thrive in school without a consistent home? I hope that you will consider not going forth with this change, as it will create more problems than it will solve and have ripple effects for many communities. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

The reality of not having a safe place to live makes individuals extremely vulnerable and creates numerous barriers to a living a healthy, productive life.  When a person does not have shelter, or even a "home base," they must carry their belongings with them.  They cannot maintain a proper diet, because there is no place to store or prepare food.  They cannot maintain proper employment, because they have no place to keep clothing or other physical necessities.  They cannot maintain proper hygiene, because they do not always have access to a bathing facility.  They live with no opportunity for privacy.  None.  Their focus becomes surviving from one day to the next.  As seen in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a person without proper shelter, food, or clothing has significantly reduced ability to prioritize ethics, morality, relationships, community, creativity.  All of their time and effort is focused on surviving another day.  And it truly is simply surviving - not living, not thriving - surviving.  To intentionally REMOVE a human being who is currently housed from said housing based on his "immigration status" is unethical, inhumane, and wrong.  <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

Our perspective is informed through interactions with our many base-building grassroots partners around the United States, who are committed to housing justice - housing as a human right by which all people are able to access high-quality, safe, and affordable housing. Among our network, housing justice is the second-most frequent social determinant of health for which our base-building partners are advocating and organizing. Our base-building partners work every day to keep families together by preserving, protecting and creating safe and affordable housing access. We are concerned that the proposed rule would diminish these efforts by separating families - or worse, putting children and others on the street.<br/>Further, this rule is predicated on Executive Order 13828, Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility. The EO states that our country was founded on principles of freedom and equal opportunity towards self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility. Diminishing children and families access to a roof over their heads, separating families and evicting individuals and families all contradict these principles.<br/>Housing stability for low-income residents is a vital social determinant of health and broader community economic stability. We already know that evictions are a health equity issue - increasing rates of evictions disproportionately impact Black women and their children. In addition, even the threat of eviction leads individuals to report poor health, high blood pressure, depression, anxiety and distress relative to people who experience stable housing. The results of evictions - including overcrowding, homelessness and emergency room visits - also demonstrate various negative health outcomes for adults and children.<br/>Eviction and other forms of housing instability, such as having to move frequently, are particularly harmful for children, which means that these rule changes would harm the health of many children living in mixed-status families. Unstable housing means that children are more likely to have behavioral problems and to struggle in school  and in classrooms where the student population changes quickly and frequently, all students can fall behind. Education itself is linked to positive health outcomes and longer lives: thus, creating housing instability in childrens lives can have immediate and negative health impacts, but can also lead to poorer health across the lifecourse by disrupting their education.<br/>When families have to put too much of their income towards their rent, they cannot afford to pay for other basic needs like food and health care. Hence, problems like food insecurity increase along with housing costs, and many renters delay needed medical care because they cant afford it.<br/>Through its anticipated impact in terms of evictions, this proposal also violates basic just cause principles which have been codified by various cities and states - often as a result of concerted effort by housing justice advocates and partly in response to the fact that evictions have the greatest impact on low-income and Black residents.<br/>Ripping families away from stable housing, or tearing families apart so that only some members can have a home while other do not, have severe and deadly public health outcomes - not just for the families, but for our society. We cannot have healthy, thriving communities by increasing separation and/or displacement and housing instability of low-income children and families.<br/>For these reasons, SMASH urges the Department to rescind this dangerous proposal which would leave families with no other choice but to either lose their homes or split up their family members. We ask that the Department instead promote policies that support access to high-quality, safe, and affordable housing as a human right.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Secretary Ben Carson,<br/><br/>I oppose HUD's proposed rule that would prohibit mixed-status families from obtaining housing assistance and ask that it be withdrawn.

I greatly appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Department of Housing and Urban Developments proposed rule on mixed status families living in public housing and Section 8 facilities. <br/><br/>I share your concern that the ongoing nationwide housing crisis leaves millions of U.S. households struggling to find affordable housing, and that HUD has a duty to improve conditions for families caught in this dire situation.  However, the newly proposed rule, which prohibits families from living in HUD-subsidized housing if even one family member is of ineligible immigration status, merely exacerbates the problem it intends to ameliorate.  As HUDs own Regulatory Impact Analysis reveals, adoption of this rule will most likely lead to tens of thousands of families abandoning the only housing they can afford, while necessitating a lowering of housing subsidy services nationwide to the eligible families who remain.  No one is well served by such an approach.<br/><br/>Because of my background and education, I have both a personal and professional interest in this issue.  I have worked in the field of community health throughout my career, but for the past 17 years I have been proud to work in Chicagos Little Village neighborhood.  This vibrant community of Latino immigrants is often referred to as the Capital of the Mexican Midwest because of the number of flourishing businesses set up here by immigrants from Mexico and their descendants.  Through my knowledge of the community and my education in public health, I know just how harmful this policy  change could be for the community I serve as well as for the U.S. as a whole.<br/><br/>I struggle to understand the rationale motivating this proposed rule change.  As you know, undocumented immigrants, the vast majority of ineligible individuals contemplated in this rule, are already prohibited by law from receiving federal housing subsidies.  Unnecessarily forcing families of mixed immigration status to choose between abandoning their loved ones and facing homelessness is antithetical to HUDs mission to improve and develop the nations communities.<br/><br/>I have attached my full comments as a PDF.  Thank you for consideration.<br/><br/>Sincerely yours,<br/><br/>Daniel Fulwiler, President and CEO<br/>Esperanza Health Centers, Chicago</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly oppose this proposal.

HUD's own analysis estimates that this proposed rule, if finalized, could result in the eviction of up to 55,000 US citizen children living in HUD-subsidized housing. This is cruel and unacceptable!<br/><br/>I strongly disagree with this revision of the current rule.

In your own impact analysis it says that around 108,000 people will be affected by the proposed changes in eligibility requirements, because one or more members of the family are undocumented. I see no reason why it is in the publics interest to threaten a hundred thousand residents of the U.S. with homelessness and as far as I have read there seems to be no benefit for the public, financial or otherwise, to imposing these new requirements.<br/><br/>The only conclusion that I can draw from this is that this measure has nothing to do with the publics interest or fighting poverty, but rather in the current administration's ongoing discursive/political battle to demonize undocumented immigrants and, within this framework of "us" and the "other", to satisfy their political base that enough has been done to fight this problem that they themselves have created.<br/><br/>For these reasons a categrically oppose the proposed rule.

On humanitarian grounds, I urge the department to reject this path and pursue compassionate approaches to housing and serving families. Having worked in the affordable housing industry (for Minnesota Housing Partnership), I have firsthand knowledge of the complexities of public housing, however, housing can be a source of strength in our communities.

It's heartless, cruel and short-sighted. Do you realize that 44% (National Alliance to End Homelessness statistic) of people experiencing homelessness are working? If you want to help those less fortunate in our society, invest in affordable housing. There is a nationwide shortage that results in tax dollars being spent to clean-up after the problem rather than preventing it in the first place.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this proposed rule which is not only cruel, but contrary to our legacy as a nation that welcomes immigrants and promotes family togetherness as a core American value.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I object HUD's proposed rule to separate mixed status families.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs rule to prohibit mixed-status immigrant families from living in subsidized housing and to ask for its withdrawal.

Please accept my comments and opposition in the strongest possible terms to this rule change that will threaten the health and well-being of families of immigrants, communities of color, and citizen and noncitizen children.<br/><br/>I am a retired teacher and a member of the Advisory Board at Childrens HealthWatch, a nonpartisan network of pediatricians and public health researchers committed to improving the health of young children and their families by informing policies that address and alleviate economic hardships. Through my work with Childrens HealthWatch and Boston Medical Center pediatric Grow Clinic, I have learned that for children to thrive, they need safe, stable homes their parents are able to afford without sacrificing other basic needs.<br/><br/>All four of my grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Ukraine in the first decade of the 1900s. As a person born 6 years after the end of WWII, I have always been acutely aware of the destruction of 6 million Jews and an entire Jewish culture in Europe. It is a supreme example of immigration as a response to persecution, violence, and genocide. At the time, the United States failed to open its doors as wide as it might have to Jews and others seeking refuge.<br/><br/>Through my work as a teacher in public schools and Newton, I have seen the damage caused to children by lack of safe homes. They suffer emotionally and physically when they are homeless, when separated from a parent, or when they experience traumatic events like eviction or neighborhood violence. <br/><br/>The proposed changes to section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 will threaten the health of children, including citizen children, and likely have lasting effects on the health of communities across our country. The changes proposed are specifically designed to force families to make choices that will harm their childs health; mixed status families would have to make the excruciating decision to either face eviction or separate as a family in order to retain housing stability. Both options will have lasting impacts on child and family health.<br/><br/>I am deeply concerned by the changes to public charge in this NPRM because the future of our communities and the country as a whole depends on a healthy, productive population. It is our duty to prepare children for participation in the economy and in our political life. We are sabotaging ourselves, if we support policies that harm childhood health, causing some children to become emotionally or physically disabled. <br/><br/>The changes outlined in this proposed rule are harmful to the children, particularly children of color, in this country. Evicting families or forcing them to separate will not only harm childrens health today, but well into the future. We need policies that expand, not reduce, access to stable homes for families with children in order to ensure all children have opportunities to be healthy and reach their highest potential. <br/><br/>For these reasons, I urge the Department to immediately withdraw this harmful proposal.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Karen Sweet<br/>Newton, Massachusetts</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This policy will harm US citizens who are children.

Maine's Regional Homeless Council System is divided into three regions.  Each Regional Homeless Council meets monthly to discuss the state of homelessness in their respective regions, emerging trends, and to discuss information to be sent to the Statewide Homeless Council (SHC) through regional representation.  The Region III Homeless Council covers Aroostook, Piscataquis, Penobscot, Hancock, and Washington counties.   <br/><br/>The Region III Homeless Council does not support any policies or rule changes that would increase homelessness and it appears, by HUDs own calculation, that this rule change would do exactly that.<br/><br/>These proposed rules would prohibit U.S. citizens and eligible immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance if they share a home with an immigrant family member whos ineligible due their immigration status.  The proposed rule also specifies that individuals who are not in eligible immigration status may not serve as the leaseholder, even as part of a mixed family whose assistance is prorated based on the percentage of members with eligible status  a practice that has been in place for more than two decades.   <br/><br/>The current rule allows for mixed-status families; under this new rule, every member of the household must be verified to be of eligible immigration status.   By HUDs own calculation, this rule could displace more than 55,000 children, all of whom are legal U.S. residents or citizens.  According to HUD, approximately 25,000 households, representing about 108,000 people, now living in subsidized housing have at least one ineligible member.  This rule change would have devastating effects on people living in poverty, with the overwhelming majority of people facing eviction being children.<br/><br/>Federal rental assistance is what allows people living in poverty, including people with disabilities, seniors, children, and people experiencing homelessness, to attain and retain housing.  In Maine 52,700 people in 33,000 households rely upon federal rental assistance, 76% of whom are seniors, children, or people with disabilities.  This rule could result in the eviction of tens of thousands of people nationwide, including thousands of children, immediately sending them into homelessness.  Maines shelters are already at or exceeding capacity; this rule change could create a homelessness crisis, specifically for families with children, which no community in Maine is equipped to face.  It helps none of us to make people, especially children, homeless.  It has been proven redundantly through numerous cost studies that housing is far less expensive than keeping people homeless.  Rule changes that increase hardships for people experiencing poverty are not helpful to them or to any of us.<br/><br/>This rule change goes against HUDs mission and the mission of the Region III Homeless Council, and for that reason, the Region III Homeless Council strongly opposes the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980: Verification of Eligible Status rule change.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/> <br/>David McCluskey<br/>Region III Co-Chair<br/>Josh D'Alessio<br/>Region III Co-Chair<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">this is disrupting 55,000 childrens lives and quite frankly racist.

But we have tried as a people, I believe, to LEARN from this. The proposed HUD Rule steps away from the hard journey we have been on to improve as a culture and a nation and would commit tear apart families and violate the lives of children. It is unthinkable.

In your response, please detail your plan to make sure that these children are housed and safe. <br/><br/>I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs rule to prohibit mixed-status immigrant families from living in subsidized housing. The rule will result in over 55,000 children being evicted from their homes, and it would be harmful to childrens development and have implications for their well-being into adulthood. It would also increase the number of children living in poverty each year. <br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development. Experiencing the stress of housing instability is harmful to young childrens development. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw its current proposal.

As a result of this rule, an estimated 55,000 children nationwide, including hundreds of students in Los Angeles will be at risk of losing the stability they need to be successful. HACLA (Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles) estimates that nearly one-third of households in Los Angeles public housing are of mixed status and that over 11,000 residents in Los Angeles could be evicted or may proactively flee for fear of repercussions.

This proposed change unjustly punishes mixed status immigrant families that are only exercising their ability access subsidized housing under current federal law. <br/><br/>I am a social worker and many of the families I work with use subsidized housing.  Subsidized housing is a key component to keeping families stable and providing safety and well-being for children and people with disabilities.  I have seen firsthand how subsidized housing can drastically alter the trajectory of a family in a positive direction. I have also witnessed how the loss of subsidized housing has very negative affects for families, children and people with disabilities.  <br/><br/>I ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn. Family unity should be considered a fundamental value and component of our immigration system. The proposed rule will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness.  Why would our government force families to make such a terrible choice?</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I do not agree with mixed families being evicted from their homes.

Ripping families away from stable housing, or tearing families apart so that only some members can have a home while others do not, has severe and deadly public health outcomes - not just for the families involved, but for our society.

The proposed rule will likely result in mass-evictions, widespread displacement, and family separation. This conclusion is supported by HUD's own analysis, which predicts up to 108,000 people, including 55,000 children, will be affected by this rule. For those ghoulish people out there for whom the idea of fiscal irresponsibility is more mortifying than the human cost of throwing thousands of families into the streets, it's worth noting that HUD estimates it will cost roughly $15 million to implement this program and it will cost over $227 million a year in additional subsidies for new tenants.<br/><br/>Of course, the proposed rule was not motivated by any sincere desire for "fiscal responsibility" or out of any reverence for the sanctity of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980. Rather, it was written to inflict as much pain and suffering as possible on the most marginalized people in our country. The moral repugnance of the proposed rule is only matched by the cowardice of the pasty bureaucrats who drafted it  given that you all likely fancy yourselves as more sophisticated and morally superior to the tiki-torch-bearing types, despite the fact you spend your days promulgating violent, yet utterly-banal administrative rules in order to preemptively combat the white nationalists' Great Replacement fantasies.<br/><br/>Shame on all of you, and may every immigrant family who loses their public housing because of this proposal move into your suburban neighborhoods and keep pushing you out until you run out of exurbs to flee to.<br/><br/>Until We Replace You,<br/>David</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">To Whom It May Concern,<br/>I would like you to know that I am against your proposal docket number FR - 6124-P-01.  <br/>I do not agree with what you are doing, since I am came from a "mixed family" and we could have not survived if this proposal was active.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) mandates that the HUD Secretary shall administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of the FHA. In its 2015 regulation, HUD defined Affirmatively further fair housing to mean taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. The affirmatively furthering fair housing obligation also includes fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.<br/><br/>The proposed rule does nothing to advance fair housing aims, or compliance with other civil rights laws. Instead, it seeks to do the exact opposite by denying housing opportunities to thousands of immigrant families, using eligible immigration status as a pretext for discriminating against individuals based on their race and national origin. Furthermore, according to HUDs own analysis, 70 percent of the households negatively impacted by this proposed rule are families with eligible children. Since minor children comprise the vast majority of eligible occupants of mixed status households, the proposed rule would also have a disproportionate and devastating impact on families with children. This clearly discriminatory policy is wholly inconsistent with HUDs obligation to combat housing discrimination and segregation.<br/><br/>I ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn.

The proposed rule is an attempt to sever these critical familial bonds, and it will force many families to choose between being torn apart and homelessness.<br/><br/>I am first generation born in the United States on my father's side. My father moved to Boston from Portugal when he was a small child. His father's father dreamed of living in this country he called America, the land of opportunity. My father's Aunts and Uncles fulfilled their father's dream of going west and emigrating to the United States of America. Through the support of family my father's father left his homeland to carve a new life in the United States, he left his wife and 2 sons behind in Portugal while he navigated around the city preparing a way to bring his family out west to a new land with opportunity. <br/>After a few years my Father's Father found a way to bring his young family to the United States, the land of opportunity.<br/>My father's family became citizens with the help of chain migration. One by one they were earning their citizenship. My father did not become a citizen until he was 18 years old. He went through elementary, middle and high school without US citizenship. His parent's worked hard and slowly learned to speak English with a very heavy Portuguese accent. My father wanted more opportunity for his future children, he did not want them to grow up poor where it is harder to find opportunity. After my father became a citizen he put himself through college earned a degree and worked and worked and worked until he became a CEO supporting a wife and 4 children. My brothers and sister all work and contribute to their community. I became a teacher and taught for many years then earned a degree as a paralegal and worked in legal aid. I currently work for a non profit doing social work. I work with foster kids who aged out of the system with no family, little skills and no place to live. I work more hours than I am paid because my job is more than a job, lives are at stake. I will dedicate my life to make the world a better place.<br/>Where would I be if the "Mixed Status" rule was in place? My father would have been sent back to Portugal and the life he created would be a different life in a different land with a different wife. All the good my family contributes to the land of opportunity would not exist.<br/>The "Mixed Status" rule takes away opportunity, with this cruel rule what would this land be without opportunity?<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this proposed rule which is not only cruel, but contrary to our legacy as a nation that welcomes immigrants and promotes family togetherness as a core American value.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly oppose this rule.

The rule will result in over 55,000 children being evicted from their homes, and it would be harmful to childrens development and have implications for their well-being into adulthood. It would also increase the number of children living in poverty each year. <br/><br/>As a pediatrician who has lived in multiple towns around the country I have seen the health impact that housing difficulties can have on our most vulnerable population. This rule will punish US citizens. The US government is there to protect its citizens. Not to punish them. Instead of making our country stronger this will start building a foundation of greater need and poor health which we will then have to deal with later.  In the long run it will cost us all more. <br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development. Experiencing the stress of housing instability is harmful to young childrens development. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw its current proposal. We need to invest in children, rather than put their healthy development and education at risk by provoking fear and destabilizing their families.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I urge the Department to rescind this dangerous proposal which would leave families with no other choice but to either lose their homes or split up their family members. I ask that the Department instead promote policies that support access to high-quality, safe, and affordable housing as a human right.<br/><br/>If passed, the Housing and Urban Development Departments proposed rule would prohibit all households with one or more ineligible individual(s) from living in public and subsidized housing. This would result in the separation or eviction of mixed status families who live in public and subsidized housing. Families could be evicted after 18 months or sooner.<br/><br/>The rule would also require tens of thousands of housing agencies and private property owners to collect documents proving the citizenship of more than 9 million assisted residents who have already attested that they are US citizens. If individuals are unable to produce the required documents in the designated time frame, they could lose their housing.<br/><br/>Eviction and other forms of housing instability, such as having to move frequently, are particularly harmful for children, which means that these rule changes would harm the health of many children living in mixed-status families. Unstable housing means that children are more likely to have behavioral problems and to struggle in school  and in classrooms where the student population changes quickly and frequently, all students can fall behind. Education itself is linked to positive health outcomes and longer lives: thus, creating housing instability in childrens lives can have immediate and negative health impacts, but can also lead to poorer health across the life course by disrupting their education.<br/><br/>When families have to put too much of their income towards their rent, they cannot afford to pay for other basic needs like food and health care. Hence, problems like food insecurity increase along with housing costs, and many renters delay needed medical care because they cant afford it.<br/><br/>Through its anticipated impact in terms of evictions, this proposal also violates basic just cause principles which have been codified by various cities and states - often as a result of concerted effort by housing justice advocates and partly in response to the fact that evictions have the greatest impact on low-income and Black residents.<br/><br/>Ripping families away from stable housing, or tearing families apart so that only some members can have a home while other do not, have severe and deadly public health outcomes - not just for the families, but for our society. We cannot have healthy, thriving communities by increasing separation and/or displacement and housing instability of low-income children and families. <br/><br/>For these reasons, I urge the Department to rescind this dangerous proposal which would leave families with no other choice but to either lose their homes or split up their family members.

Estimates, according to HUD's own analysis, could affect approximately 32,000 families and put 55,000 children at risk of eviction and therefore homelessness. This is morally unacceptable, not to mention ineffective at addressing the needs of people on the affordable housing waitlist and/or people immigrating to the US.<br/><br/>The results of this proposal do not align with the administration's stated goals to free up waitlists on public housing. As the current policy already stands, subsidies are calculated by prorating for people in each household who have documented status. In addition, in the one county where I live-- Miami Dade County alone, roughly 70,000 people are on the waitlist for public housing while 4.4 million people in the whole country are on this waitlist. If the administration claims to care about freeing up the waitlist for public housing, it would take actions that not only do not cause significant distress and danger to people's lives, but address this often deadly problem of access to housing (in healthy and humane conditions) much more broadly and structurally.<br/><br/>The results of this proposal also do not align with HUD Secretary Carson's stated goal to put "America's most vulnerable first". People immigrate to the United States in order to attain better lives for themselves and escape the dangers that poverty and violence pose to them. Moreover, they immigrate to the US within the larger context of global economics and politics that create unsafe situations for them, situations often exacerbated by US foreign policy. The most vulnerable people in America are people whose lives are threatened by the effects of poverty and violence, a category which thereby already includes immigrants to the US who have left perilous conditions and are now facing them again.<br/><br/>Please do not put this inhumane proposal into effect.<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I do not understand why we continue to make it more difficult for families to have a decent home.

This rule is cruel and would cause great harm to over 100,000 people, including more than 55,000 children who are US citizens or have legal status. The supposed justification for this rule-reducing wait lists-has already been disproven by HUD's own analysis, proving there is no true purpose behind this rule, other than a desire to discriminate and cause harm.<br/><br/>Families belong together. In a time when families across our nation struggle to find affordable housing, causing a nationwide surge in families that are homeless will create endless problems and have an expansive, negative effect, far beyond the families directly impacted by this rule.<br/><br/>This cruel and unnecessary rule should be immediately withdrawn.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Secretary Ben Carson,<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule that would prohibit mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing. I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity. It is important to keep in mind that having 62,400 women and girls made homeless will be a real burden to communities and this administration.

A US Citizen, born in America, whose mother could no longer care for him. His grandmother came to the United States through a special program granting her access - based on the fact that she had been a victim of a horrific violent crime and was willing to testify against her attacker. While in the US, she was granted legal guardianship of her grandson - although her own status was temporary as she wound her way through onerous processes &amp; legal proceedings. She was able to secure employment as a caregiver in an assisted living facility - but in a growing economy with rising rents, she couldn't afford to rent at fair market prices. She was able to access the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, and receive partial subsidy based on the citizenship of her grandson. That assistance helped them stabilize, ending their homelessness, and helping Joseph to excel in school. He is now in high school, working a part-time job, on the hockey team - - - because of the supports for safe, stable, affordable housing provided to his family. He is a citizen, and shouldn't be denied access to supports based on the status of the only person able to care for him. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

I am applaud Mr. Carson for his efforts and believe more regulations like this should be in place such as for hiring and homeownership those who were not born in this country but who have waited in line for legal citizenship should receive first right.

I am strongly opposed to this rule change because it threatens the health and well-being of families of immigrants, communities of color, and citizen and noncitizen children. <br/><br/>I am an Experimental Psychologist and a member of the Advisory Board at Childrens HealthWatch, a nonpartisan network of pediatricians and public health researchers committed to improving the health of young children and their families by informing policies that address an alleviate economic hardships. All children in the United States, regardless of color or immigration status need safe, stable homes their parents are able to afford without sacrificing other basic needs.   The proposed changes are yet another short-sighted and cruel means of attacking immigrants.  This proposal will hurt immigrants where they will most feel itby hurting their children.  <br/><br/>The proposed changes to section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 threaten the health of children, including citizen children, and will have lasting effects on the health of children and their families across the US. Damage that is done now from this harmful rule will haunt our country for years to come.  <br/><br/>The changes outlined in this proposed rule are targeting children, particularly children of color. Evicting families or forcing them to separate will not only harm childrens health today, but well into the future. I urge the Department to immediately withdraw this harmful proposal.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Shelly Chigier, Ph.D.<br/>Manchester, MA </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This rule of separating families just because of their immigration status us foolish, unAmerican, disturbing, cruel and unnecessary!

This rule is another example - the outcome of the rule will be the denial of affordable housing options to U.S. citizen children in the name of...well, it's not clear what the purpose is. To keep people from unfairly taking advantage of government benefits? The current policy already does that. So I must conclude that it is out of heartlessness and with cruel intention that the rule is proposed. I urge those with any say in whether this rule moves forward to see this for what it is - a malicious attack on families and children that will harm thousands of US citizens, in addition to others who do not deserve cruelty, no matter what one thinks of their presence in our country. The continued actions of the current administration that knowingly, perhaps even purposefully, harm children are unconscionable.

This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity.

So many are upset about the children who will be homeless should this prevail, what about the United States citizens who are currently homeless?  Currently Section 8 waiting lists are hopelessly long and several are closed, what makes these citizens less important than the ineligible non-citizens who are receiving the prorated assistance?  As far as administrative, burden I am not seeing it!  SAVE is a an easy system to use and offers training.  Seems to me it would be harder to continue to try to verify income for someone who is either giving the housing authority a false name, giving their employer a false name, or working for cash than it would be to verify citizenship.  It is nearly impossible to obtain an employment verification for someone who is not working legally.  What employer would want to hand over that kind of documentation?  This is also why many of them are working for cash, it is much easier to hide cash.  This money is generally not being included in the families income because it is not reported and can't be verified. These children are not going to be homeless, the families are bringing in enough to sustain them plus they are not being taxed or having anything deducted from the cash.  They will be just fine, lets take care of our own.<br/><br/>I do not understand how or why the citizens of the United States of America are more concerned about the well being of citizens of other countries above and beyond citizens of their own country.  I understand compassion and humanity, but in the grand scheme of things wouldn't each of you take care of your own before you take care of your neighbor?  I believe your neighbor would take care of themselves before taking care of you.  <br/><br/>There are several people who have come to this country legally.  They are proud to be here, they are proud to be American, and they are happy to show you their documentation.  They worked hard for what they have and went about it the correct way.

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>[Insert personal stories that illustrate the importance of housing access]<br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule. Instead of making our country go into more debt, the humane step is to allot money for the housing that many in our rich country cannot afford. Or better yet, let's reduce the money that congress republicans are sucking up for their own pockets and use that for those who need it!</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">To the General Counsel:<br/><br/>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has proposed requiring all residents of public and assisted housing to verify their status as citizens or eligible noncitizens or face eviction, regardless of whether such action would endanger, for instance, eligible children.<br/><br/>This proposed rule betrays HUD's mission as a housing agency.  As a citizen who wants all in this country to have a safe place to call home, I ask you to leave the current regulations governing verification of eligible status in place unchanged.<br/><br/>The proposed rule has three obvious practical and moral flaws.  If implemented, the proposed rule would:<br/><br/>1. House fewer people at greater cost.  HUD's own economic analysis accompanying the rule makes this flaw evident.  Currently, households that include members who have not declared themselves eligible receive less assistance on a pro-rata basis and therefore pay more rent.  The average difference in subsidy between mixed-eligibility households and unmixed-eligibility households is $2,100 per year, according to HUD's analysis.  That translates to roughly $200 million of increased cost that HUD acknowledges "would be paid for by reducing average spending on housing assistance...or reducing the number of households served."  That is not the mission of an American housing agency.<br/><br/>2. Create fear.  The proposed rule is transparently designed to frighten immigrants, both the undocumented and those who fear being mistaken for undocumented.  Many immigrants come to this country fleeing oppression.  We should fulfill the American tradition of opportunity and freedom, not oppress those already in fear.  Yet, HUD's analysis states the expected result of the proposed rule: "fear of the family being separated would lead to prompt evacuation by most mixed household, whether that fear is justified."  That is not the mission of an American housing agency.<br/><br/>3. Put American children at risk of homelessness.  HUD's analysis shows that more than 55,000 children who are citizens or otherwise eligible to receive assistance would face eviction or departure in fear.  (HUD states that children are 73% of the 75,930 people in households with eligible children but one or more ineligible adults.)  These households are in public or assisted housing because there are not  better alternatives, so homelessness is an all too real risk for those evicted.  This is especially true in tight housing markets72% of the people immediately affected by this rule live in California, New York, or Texas.  If this rule is made final, many people will leave in a hurry, and many will end up homeless.  That is not the mission of an American housing agency.<br/><br/>The Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 does not require draconian action or cruelty to enforce its provisions.  For nearly forty years, HUD has administered the restrictions based on eligible status humanely by pro-rating assistance to those residents who declare eligibility and are verified.  HUD could continue to do so.<br/><br/>Even if HUD is myopically focused on preventing any assistance to any family that includes even one ineligible resident, there are ways to accomplish that end without imposing fear and pain on currently assisted families.  HUD could begin checking status for newly assisted households, letting those currently assisted gradually move off the rolls.  HUD's analysis suggests this would take approximately seven years, a short time to wait to avoid awful consequences.<br/><br/>Given that the law does not require this action and that there are more humane alternatives, every HUD employee should ask themselves whether this proposed rule fulfills the oath they swore to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution.  Every American should ask themselves. "Is this how I want my housing agency to behave?"<br/><br/>I hope that HUD answers those questions honestly and rejects this proposed rule.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Stephanie Archer</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This regulation is inhumane and it is sad to see families separated.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">please do not discriminate against families who are living in the projects because some of them have no documents.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">No one deserves to live with the fear that they may be forcefully separated from their family.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Yo Maria les pido de corazon que retiren esta propuesta que no es nada humana les agradezco que tomen en cuenta mi peticion gracias y Dios les bendiga. <br/><br/>I, Maria, ask from the bottle of my heart that you withdraw this proposal which is not humane and I thank that you are taking this ask seriously.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing.

It is about time this was addressed. We have thousands of American families struggling and on waiting list for government assisted housing, while illegal immigrants are being housed and assisted. Just in New York City ALONE there are 209,180 families on the waiting list for public housing as of May 2018.Our fellow Americans and citizens come first. Why are illegal immigrants entitled to government assistance before our own people? We as Americans should put our citizens first. According to the HUD'S Annual Point In Time Count report there are 552,830 homeless Americans including veterans, families, youth, and individuals. Government housing that is being occupied by illegal immigrants could be used for them. Any congressman or woman who denies this change should have to face the hundreds of Americans on the waiting list, and homeless veterans and explain to them in person why they should be put beneath illegal immigrants. Also the new proposal states the deferral period would be 6 months and the aggregate deferral period is 18 months. That allows ample time for them to find other accommodations. We need to house our veterans, fellow Americans, and homeless families first. Our government assist illegal immigrants more than most countries in the world. "Analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies of the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) shows welfare use by households headed by non-citizens is very high" (Camarota &amp; Ziegler,2018,pg.1). In 2014 statistics showed 63% of households headed by a non citizen admitted to using at least 1 welfare program. The study also found that citizen households use of food programs were much less than non citizen households. Even Medicaid was being utilized by non citizen households over twice as much as citizen households. We help out illegal immigrants plenty in this country, and we should not be placing them in housing before our own citizens and veterans. We have thousands of struggling families, veterans, and homeless Americans that need our help. We as the American people owe it to them to take care of them first. They are why HUD was created in the first place. We can NOT and will not place illegal immigrants before them.<br/><br/>Sources: one source not attached below due to large PDF file size but will place link below<br/>2018 AHAR Report: Part 1 - PIT Estimates of Homelessness<br/>https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2018-AHAR-Part-1.pdf<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This is yet another destructive rule change from this minority "administration" that targets immigrant families.

This proposed change unjustly punishes mixed status immigrant families that are only exercising their ability access subsidized housing under current federal law. <br/><br/>I ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn. Family unity should be considered a fundamental value and component of our immigration system. The proposed rule will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness.<br/><br/>South Suburban PADS is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization that is working to prevent and end homelessness in the south suburbs of Chicago.  Over the past 28 years, the organization has provided shelter and meals to enable over 17,000 people to survive homelessness.  In addition, South Suburban PADS provides pathways home and currently helps over 500 people to preserve or access affordable rental homes every year.  South Suburban PADS is the proud recipient of the 2018 Bank of America Neighborhood Builders Award.  <br/><br/>The proposed rule is in direct conflict with federal policy priorities of ending homelessness and federal mandates for states to provide certain assistance and programs to everyone. For example, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) has prioritized ending and preventing homelessness among families with children, regardless of immigration status. The proposed rule directly contradicts this policy goal by erecting additional barriers to housing access. Furthermore, the rule is in conflict with the National Affordable Housing Acts edict to ensure that every American family be able to afford a decent home in a suitable environment.<br/><br/>People who lose their housing due to the proposed rule will have a very challenging time time finding housing they can afford. In Illinois, there are just 35 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income renter households. Moreover, seventy-two percent of extremely low-income renter households are severely housing cost-burdened, spending more than half of their income on housing, with little left over for other basic necessities. This puts them on the brink, just one financial setback away from eviction and homelessness.<br/><br/>Although HUD acknowledges the potential costs of homelessness in their Regulatory Impact Analysis, noting that temporary and long-term homelessness is a likely for many families because of the proposed rule, it has not provided a detailed analysis of this economic impact. To fully understand the fiscal consequences of this rule, HUD should complete an in-depth study on these issues before finalizing the proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

Family unity is a fundamental American value and a cornerstone of our immigration system. The proposed rule is an attempt to sever these critical familial bonds, and it will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness.<br/><br/>I live with an inter-generational family -- with my parents, my sister, my aunt, and my grandmother. And I know that many of my cousins also live in similar inter-generational families. These inter-generational communities are traditional for my family and it's normalized so that we depend on each other and have created that community for us to work with each other. And it's been a form of stability in my childhood. Whenever my parents were working, my aunt or grandmother was able to take care of my sister and me, providing food and education. Whenever my aunt was working as well, my grandmother filled in those gaps. <br/><br/>The stability at home helped my focus in academia and in school, so that I was able to focus on my work, my education, and my future. It was so I didn't worry as much about basic needs like food, sleep, shelter. And my parents didn't worry about how they were going to take care of my sister or me, because they could rely on our inter-generational family.<br/><br/>And it's these inter-generational communities that are often mixed-status immigrant families as well. Taking that away, making it more difficult for families to be together, to take care of each other just means more instability in young people's lives, in our children's lives. We need to ensure that our youth, our kids, are able to have a prosperous future. And oftentimes, that means keeping families together so we can care for each other.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this proposed rule which is not only cruel, but contrary to our legacy as a nation that welcomes immigrants and promotes family togetherness as a core American value.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">If the Trump administration was serious about addressing the housing crisis in the U.S. today, they would not have slashed funding for affordable housing in their FY 2020 HUD budget request.<br/>This rule change seems to be rooted in the strong anti-immigrant stance that is a hallmark of this administration rather than in a genuine concern for the housing needs of low-income individuals and families.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I write to protest this proposed rule that would separate mixed citizenship households.

How wrong and unprincipled can Secretary Carson be!  <br/>I am in oppositon to the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule that would prohibit mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing.

This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.  <br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.  Have you no compassion.  They took homes away from families in Europe during WWII and we looked at this as a hate crime and definitely non Christian.  Now it is being proposed here by families who are doing their best to try to support their children.

I urge the rule to be withdrawn in its entirety, and that HUDs long-standing regulations remain in effect.<br/><br/>I have worked in community colleges in rural areas of the "heartland" and public libraries in the midwest. My institutions work with many immigrant families who are already faced with so many challenges to meet ends meet and understand how to live in their adopted country. Many of these communities already feel terrorized and targeted by current policies that they are hesitant to take advantage of services such as ESOL or HSED classes that could help their entire family improve their lives. <br/><br/>Although HUD contends that the proposed rule is a means of addressing the waitlist crisis faced by a majority of Public Housing Authorities nationwide, it is clear that the proposed rule is a part of the current administrations coordinated attack on immigrant families. We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. Indeed, HUDs own analysis of the proposed rule concludes that fewer, not more, families are likely to receive assistance as a result of the rule. The real issue is the lack of sufficient funding to ensure that every family, regardless of immigration status, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The proposed rule places tens of thousands of immigrant families at risk of homelessness, jeopardizing their family and housing stability, both of which are critical to getting families on a pathway to self-sufficiency and better life outcomes. Since 70% of mixed status families currently receiving HUD assistance are composed of eligible children and at least one ineligible parent, it is likely that these families will forgo the subsidies to avoid separation. here are over 38,000 U.S. citizen and otherwise eligible children in these families, and over 55,000 eligible children in mixed status families overall. Since these children lack the legal capacity to sign leases themselves, the adult heads of household, including those who do not receive assistance, must sign these contracts on behalf of their family. However, by prohibiting the ineligible adults from living in subsidized units, the proposed rule forecloses the possibility of these U.S. citizen and LPR children from receiving any housing assistance under the covered housing programs. <br/><br/>The proposed regulations are in direct conflict with their underlying statute and ignore amendments that Congress made to Section 214. n fact, Section 214 clearly conveys that Congress intended to ensure that individuals with eligible immigration status would receive assistance while keeping mixed status families together in the same home. The plain language of the statute conveys this intent. For example, 42 U.S.C.  1436a(b)(2) states, If the eligibility for financial assistance of at least one member of a family has been affirmatively established under this section, and the ineligibility of one or more family members has not been affirmatively established under this section, any financial assistance made available to that family by the applicable Secretary shall be prorated (emphasis added). The law explicitly permits housing authorities to choose not to affirmatively establish ineligibility. Congress did not mince words. Shall be prorated does not mean may be prorated for some period of time. In mixed status families, HUD must provide prorated assistance.  <br/><br/> In addition to attacking mixed status families, the proposed rule creates red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million U.S. citizens currently receiving HUD assistance and all future U.S. citizens seeking these benefits.  The rule would require that all who declare they are U.S. citizens under penalty of perjury provide evidence of their citizenship, a practice that has proven to be burdensome, costly and unnecessary to protect program integrity. Currently, to establish eligibility for access Section 214 housing assistance, U.S. citizens need to provide a declaration signed under penalty of perjury of their citizenship or nationality status. The proposed rule would require that these individuals also provide documentary proof of citizenship or nationality, such as a birth certificate, which can be extremely difficult for certain segments of the population - 18 percent of citizens over the age 65 do not have a photo ID.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I think this is a completely unnecessary bill which will result in the unnecessary use of public funds which would be better spent elsewhere.

That is clearly impossible. But our country is and always has been a country of immigrants.  That is a FACT. The current hysteria regarding immigrants is the height of hypocrisy. There is no need to treat would-be immigrants as criminals.  All one has to do is look at the case of recreational use of marijuana and before that the use of alcohol.  Criminalizing those activities has clearly now been viewed as wrong and counter-productive and a waste of public resources.

What is a mixed-status family anyway? Should it be taken to mean a family that has someone who may be ineligible for assistance owing to immigration status but also includes others who are eligible, that would likely preclude a multitude of immigrant families from obtaining needed housing. It likely would make some such families completely pass up applying for housing assistance or else have to divide themselves up to live separately. And then those families with some of them considered ineligible could well be evicted from subsidized housing.<br/><br/>I therefore believe the rule should be totally withdrawn. It's unconscionable to make mixed families--of which there are hundreds or thousands in need of HUD assistance--have to choose those alternatives mentioned above. This administration excels at achieving family separation. That's contrary to the fundamental American values of fairness and equal treatment of residents in need of assistance. <br/><br/>Moreover, the additional red tape in this proposed rule creates an extraordinary morass for those who dare to brave the thicket of requirements. Such excessive requirements for documentation will pose severe barriers to applicants over 50, to people of color, to disabled people, and to low-income residents in general. <br/><br/>I'd prefer instead to see HUD seek from Congress funding to help even more families to get affordable and appropriate housing for their circumstances. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Christopher Hamilton<br/>1316 Albina Ave  Berkeley, CA 94706-2506</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Secretary Ben Carson,<br/><br/>I am horrified by this administration's treatment of immigrants and asylum seekers.

Blighted housing is everywhere. I own a little house in an old, "bad" part of town. A block away, an entire apartment complex, including a high-rise, recently evicted every single tenant as the owner failed to pay water bills and the buildings fell below code. On a small scale, this kind of thing is common in this area. Section 8 folks are thrown out, their stuff put on the curb for all to view for weeks, and they have nowhere to go.  We all suffer from this.  In the meantime, there are many vacant houses that cannot be sold because there is no market for them. Any decrease to public housing assistance will make this whole problem much worse. Homeless people are visible in several parts of town every day. I see them on my residential street every day, and they live in the woods as best they can. <br/><br/>For this and other reasons, I oppose the plan to eliminate subsidies to families with mixed immigration status.  Non-mixed families have an average income of $4000 less than mixed income families which would result in increased subsidies by the government. To make up for this difference, it is likely that HUD would have to reduce the quantity and quality of assisted housing in response to higher costs. For public housing, that would likely have an impact on the quality of services such as maintenance of the units and possibly deterioration of the units that could lead to vacancy. HUD also says that in some cases, the proposed rule could lead to more homelessness which has a cost of an estimated $20,000 to $50,000  a year per individual. Overall, the effects would be unpredictable, widespread, and negative for the entire community.<br/><br/>In addition to being economically unwise, the proposal is mean and immoral. I see every day how tough it is for those on the low end of our economy.  I do not believe the myth of the "welfare queen."

Our organization is deeply concerned that this proposed rule change has the potential to force thousands of vulnerable low-income individuals and families into homelessness.<br/><br/>This proposed rule change threatens our mission of Hope Through Empowerment. As such, we oppose this proposed<br/>change as its implementation may jeopardize the health, well being, and housing security of Los Angeles, California residents. We urge the Administration to withdraw this proposal and instead work with local housing providers to develop policies and practices that are safe, supportive, and contribute to healthy communities and residents.<br/><br/>Los Angeles County is home to just about 3.5 million immigrants and also has some of the highest housing<br/>cost burdens in the state. This leaves many of our immigrant and non-immigrant neighbors reliant on<br/>subsidized housing in order to remain sheltered. By restricting the use of federally-subsidized housing for<br/>ineligible immigrants, this proposed rule change has the potential to force thousands of individuals in Los<br/>Angeles County into homelessness, an already growing crisis. In Service Provider Area 5 (SPA 5) according to the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority's Homeless Count, homelessness increased by 19% in SPA 5.<br/><br/>Currently, HUD regulations do not allow for any portion of a housing subsidy to go to an ineligible<br/>immigrant. Mixed-status families (consisting of an ineligible immigrant and eligible immigrants and/or U.S.<br/>citizens) receive a prorated subsidy that is based on the number of eligible members of the household. By<br/>HUDs own analysis, the removal of prorated subsidies would cost HUD an estimated additional $193 to<br/>$227 million annually in order to serve the same number of individuals. This means that HUD would need<br/>Congress to either significantly increase funding to the public housing and HCV programs or serve<br/>significantly fewer households.<br/><br/>This proposed change forces families to choose between separating or being evicted and becoming<br/>vulnerable to homelessness.

This new rule would prevent the families of any undocumented individuals from receiving federal housing aid, no matter how terrible the cost to their children who are legal residents or citizens. The primary result of this rule would be the separation of families and the eviction of our neighbors from their homes.<br/><br/>This rule would cruelly force mixed-status families out of public housing. Secretary Carson and HUD should be ashamed.<br/><br/>Queens is the most ethnically and racially diverse county in the United States. Almost half (47.8%) of our population is foreign-born. According to the Migration Policy Institute, over 68,000 children in Queens County live in mixed-status families  the highest proportion in all of New York State.<br/><br/>According to HUD's own analysis, this rule would force 25,000 mixed-status families nationwide  and nearly 2,200 families residing in New York  onto the streets. In total, 55,000 children would be impacted and could be forced out of their homes. HUD has admitted that it expects that fear of the family being separated would lead to prompt evacuation by most mixed households, whether that fear is justified. This proposed rule obviously contravenes HUDs stated mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.<br/><br/>HUDs argument for this proposed rule is that it would help U.S. citizens and legal residents expedite their receipt of federal housing subsidies, ignoring the fact that its primary result would be the opposite: the eviction of thousands of U.S. citizens and legal residents, primarily innocent children who happen to be related to an undocumented individual in their home.<br/><br/>Housing is a human right and more affordable housing needs to be created to ensure our families can thrive in our city and our country. I appeal to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to withdraw this proposed rule and ensure that families and children can stay together.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Mr. Paul Compton<br/>General Counsel<br/>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development<br/>451 7th Street SW, Room 10276<br/>Washington, D.C. 20410-0500<br/><br/>RE: Docket No. FR-6124-9-01: Verification of Eligible Status<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Compton,<br/><br/>I am writing to express my opposition to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule change, entitled Verification of Eligible Status, which would restrict the use of federally-assisted housing covered under Section 214 for ineligible immigrants.<br/><br/>I am a tenant in the City of Pasadena, California, and I have worked in homeless services in Los Angeles in the past. I have seen first hand how insecure housing is for the poorest members of our community. Homelessness has increased in Los Angeles County by 16% in the past year. The new rule, if enacted, will undoubtedly force thousands more Angelenos out onto the street. Not only is this inhumane, it is more expensive for the City, County, and HUD, to assist homeless people than it is to keep them housed in the first place.<br/><br/>I am also a member of my local Pasadena Tenants Union and a volunteer for the Pasadena Tenants Justice Coalition. We work almost daily with tenants who are being unjustly evicted for burden by rents that are 40-50% and more of the monthly income. And we wonder why homelessness is increasing in our large cities.<br/><br/>Based on these factors, I oppose this proposed change as its implementation may jeopardize the health, well-being, and housing security of the residents of Los Angeles County. We urge the Administration to withdraw this proposal and instead work with local housing providers to develop policies and practices that are safe, supportive, and contribute to healthy communities and residents.<br/><br/>Los Angeles County is home to just about 3.5 million immigrants and also has some of the highest housing cost burdens in the state. This leaves many of our immigrant and non-immigrant neighbors reliant on subsidized housing in order to remain sheltered. By restricting the use of federally-subsidized housing for ineligible immigrants, this proposed rule change has the potential to force thousands of individuals in Los Angeles County into homelessness, an already growing crisis. {Insert one or two sentences about population experiencing homelessness in your service area}.<br/><br/>Currently, HUD regulations do not allow for any portion of a housing subsidy to go to an ineligible immigrant. Mixed-status families (consisting of an ineligible immigrant and eligible immigrants and/or U.S. citizens) receive a prorated subsidy that is based on the number of eligible members of the household. By HUDs own analysis, the removal of prorated subsidies would cost HUD an estimated additional $193 to $227 million annually in order to serve the same number of individuals. This means that HUD would need Congress to either significantly increase funding to the public housing and HCV programs or serve significantly fewer households.<br/><br/>This proposed change forces families to choose between separating or being evicted and becoming vulnerable to homelessness. It will bring financial hardship onto more families, and potentially weaken the familial and social networks that can help defend against homelessness. Additionally, children of ineligible immigrants (many of whom are U.S.-born) may end up in the care of other family members or friends and, quite possibly, even foster care. Thousands of children may end up losing either family members or stable housing.<br/><br/>We appreciate the opportunity to provide comment on this rule change. We look forward to working with<br/>HUD to craft policies that ensure opportunity and safety for all residents of our communities.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Ryan Bell<br/>Member, Pasadena Tenants Union</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">To whomever it may concern,<br/>As a pediatrician, I am shocked and dismayed at the proposal to evict children from public housing based on their parents' immigration status. What we know about child health and development is that stable housing is crucial to their well-being - homelessness is a source of toxic stress that results in a complete re-wiring of the brain, from an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex (the part of our brain that helps us with self-regulation and high executive functioning) and activates our cortisol axis, meaning that risk for development of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and certain types of cancer is higher - EVEN when a child leaves poverty as an adult. Once the brain and body develop in a toxic environment, there's no going back. So if the administration cares about adults who are healthy and economically productive, employed, etc. they would start taking the needs of children far more seriously. If the argument regards waiting lists, please consider EXPANDING access to public housing rather than evicting, because as it stands, we need a home, basic income, freedom for hunger, and good education/economic opportunity to be successful. I don't understand why the science is so clear, but no one in government is listening. I am so disappointed in this decision and am writing on behalf of my patients.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am a US citizen and support the Bill FR-6124-P-01.<br/>I think only US citizens should be the only ones  that can receive  Federally Insured loans in our country.<br/><br/>Thank you,<br/>Pat Fenton<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>I work in a Federally Qualified Health Center in CA. A large portion of our patients are children of undocumented people who are considered members of our community and human beings in need of medical care and housing support. This legislation is cruel and would go directly against our health center's mission statement of "leveling the playing field of human dignity". <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs rule to prohibit mixed-status immigrant families from living in subsidized housing. The rule will result in over 55,000 children being evicted from their homes, and it would be harmful to childrens development and have implications for their well-being into adulthood. It would also increase the number of children living in poverty each year. <br/><br/>I have been a Social Worker in New York for 12 years. In my time working with families - nothing was more distressing and disruptive than homelessness. Just the stress of possibly losing housing is overwhelming for parents. We cannot ignore the impact on the child either. Homelessness is incredibly traumatic for children - it disrupts their education in the immediate crisis, but also ongoing - there are gaps to be made up, there is the stress of a threat of losing your home again in the future, the pressure of the stigma associated with homelessness, the separation of family from each other - from other supportive people (church, neighbors, school) and from pets (they are beloved family members as well!). <br/>During those 12 years, I spent 4 years as the Director of the only Emergency Family shelter in our county. What a difficult job that was! I would see women arrive pregnant, deliver their baby and return to the shelter with their newborn. Mom did the right thing by leaving a very dangerous and violent relationship and coming to the shelter. I am proud that we were able to provide her a safe place to return with the infant, but also saddened by the thought of a temporary home for that baby.<br/><br/>We should not be in the habit of separating families, no matter what. It is unacceptable. It is heartless, it is unnecessary. These choices are quick reactions and not thoughtful responses. We are creating a humanitarian crisis. This will damage people, adults and children, for generations. They will carry that trauma for their lives. If we consider ourselves and moral, just and/or Christian nation - we cannot in true Christian form, even consider doing the things we have been doing. It's just not right.<br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development. Experiencing the stress of housing instability is harmful to young childrens development. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw its current proposal. We need to invest in children, rather than put their healthy development and education at risk by provoking fear and destabilizing their families.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This proposed rule is costly, counterproductive, and cruel. It would likely result in 108,000 public housing residents, including 55,000 children -- tens of thousands of whom are U.S. Citizens -- becoming homeless.  <br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>Moreover, this proposed rule does not even fulfill its stated purpose of increasing efficiency and saving resources. By increasing the concentration of family members within a single household who qualify for subsidies, HUD's outlay for subsidies will increase between $193 million and $227 million annually, according to HUD's own analysis.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>According to HUD's analysis, the increased costs of giving a higher level of subsidy per household will "reduce the quantity and quality of assisted housing in response to higher costs." <br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>Therefore, HUD's analysis continued, "there could be fewer households served under the housing choice vouchers program." Reducing the quality and quantity of public housing, in response to the increased cost of this proposed rule, will *lengthen* the wait time on public housing waiting lists for needy U.S. Citizen families, not reduce it. U.S. Citizen families will have to wait longer for public housing, and face slimmer chances of being chosen by the Section 8 Housing Choice voucher lottery, because of this cruel, costly, counterproductive rule.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>According to HUD's own analysis, the increased costs imposed by the rule would lower the quality of services in public housing, and reduce funding for the maintenance of units. HUD has warned of "possibly deterioration of the units that could lead to vacancy". That means that needy U.S. Citizen families will go homeless while once-serviceable public housing goes empty and falls into disrepair.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>By the grace of God, and after many years on all possible public-housing waiting lists, my disabled adult cousin, for whom I provide personal support and care, has just moved into supportive public housing for people with disabilities. My cousin is a United States Citizen. I thank God every single day for the public housing complex that has lifted the fear of homelessness and has offered safety and stability to my beloved family member.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>This proposed rule hurts U.S. Citizens. It hurts Lawful Permanent Residents. It hurts people in lawful immigration status, as well as their and their friends and neighbors. It hurts all those who need public housing the most.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>Homelessness is costly. Homelessness is dangerous. Homelessness damages public health and public sanitation. Homelessness reduces civic participation. Homelessness is bad for business and for the economy. Homelessness increases reliance on costly emergency services. Homelessness harms kids' chances to get an education. Homelessness contributes to generational cycles of psychological trauma. As a formerly homeless person myself (now a proud head of household), I can personally attest to its devastating effects.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>Affordable, subsidized, and public housing, coupled with smart urban development and protections against discrimination, have the power to END the scourge of homelessness. This rule would deprive HUD of the funding it so desperately needs to carry out this vital public mission.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>Why is HUD proposing to tear down its reason for being, by stealing from its own coffers? Just to promote the identity politics of social exclusion, based on petty and arbitrary categories, like the national origins of one's parents?<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>We are better than this, America.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/>Thank you for your consideration of my comment.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/><br/>Sources:<br/> <br/>HUD Analysis:<br/><br/>https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=HUD-2019-0044-0002<br/><br/>Description of the Proposed Rule:<br/><br/>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/05/10/2019-09566/housing-and-community-development-act-of-1980-verification-of-eligible-status<br/><br/>Washington Post Analysis:<br/><br/>https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/10/hud-says-children-could-be-displaced-under-trump-plan-evict-undocumented-immigrants/<br/><br/>National Public Radio Analysis:<br/><br/>https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/722173775/proposed-rule-could-evict-55-000-children-from-subsidized-housing</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule to prohibit mixed status families from living in subsidized housing.

It's not clear -- or, compelling -- from the Secretary's language what problem needs to be addressed and fixed by the proposed rule change.  Beyond the technical/language elements described in the changes, little in the way of budgetary, regulatory or policy implementation needs are articulated or defined in such a way to warrant the changes proposed.<br/><br/>2.  There is indeed a growing problem in our country regarding the insufficient supply of affordable housing.  The Department's programs are important and effective tools working to address this.  There's no evidence in the Department's own analyses that the changes proposed will result in more affordable housing for more individuals and families in the United States.<br/><br/>3. The rule changes appear to be extensions of the Administration's immigration policies than housing policies.  While I applaud the consistency being applied, using the Department's programs as a tool for reducing services to non-citizens is a blunt and misapplied strategy.  Implications of the rule changes are likely to lead to more homelessness.  That homelessness -- regardless of the nationality of the homeless individuals -- is not consistent with our values as a country.  Pragmatically, causing more homelessness is a horrible idea for our communities.<br/><br/>4.  I'm glad the Administration is choosing to retain exemptions in the rules for seniors.  Understanding that there's both some compassion and practical realities built into that exemption, the Administration should explore similar exemptions for children such that they and their families are not excluded from these needed programs.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Secretary Ben Carson,<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule that would prohibit mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing. I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity.<br/><br/>Its very confusing how you can belong to the party of family values and still espouse this type of cruel and needless separation.

Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>I just finished reading a book describing fascism in great detail:  one of the driving forces in fascism is to identify a group of people to be targeted as "other."  This proposed rule is one part of the fascist practices of our current government.  At some point, whether in this life time or beyond, those people who are creating these policies and regulations, and initiating these practices, will have to answer for their behavior.  Sooner, rather than later, I hope.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing.

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>I work as a housing coordinator and have seen first hand how hardworking and dedicated mixed status families are. Parents know that they are putting everything on the line for their children and are working hard to make sure that their family has a roof over their head. The HUD subsidies do not apply to undocumented family members, only those who are documented, which means that there is no unfair benefit to non-citizen family members. The act of displacing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, simply because someone in the family is not in possession of the correct paperwork is morally corrupt. Not only that, but it will affect tens of thousands of citizens of the United States for whom there is no question of their right to receive housing assistance. Eviction is a leading driver of homelessness and at a time when housing accessibility is at a low, it is unconscionable to purposefully evict so many people.  <br/><br/>This is not only a moral issue, but a financial issue as well. It's been shown that the cost of families and individuals remaining homeless is actually much higher than if they are housed. If families are displaced, they will need emergency services that cost much more than the limited subsidies that mixed-status families receive. Eviction leads to job loss, educational instability for children, hunger and the dangers of sleeping in temporary shelter or outside. The cost of providing these emergency services are a burden, and increasing the number of people that would need access to emergency services will be much more costly that allowing people to remain in housing where they are safe, their needs are met and they are able to support their families.<br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

There is no economic, social or moral basis for this proposal nor is it supported by any experts. The fallout would furthermore be disastrous for the city as a whole but the consequences appear to have been calculated to both punish immigrants as well as "enemy territories" in the eyes of the current administration.

As someone who works in both homeless service provision as well as being an advocate for immigrant rights I can assure you that if this rule passes it will not only be devastating for thousands of families but will also have a very harmful impact on our society as a whole.<br/>The Trump administration's tactic for terrorizing immigrant communities has been to tear families apart whenever possible. This rule is just an additional attempt to do just that, forcing families into a traumatic situation in which they must choose between staying together as a family and homelessness. Furthermore, this proposed rule is serves only the purpose of furthering a racist agenda in this country as there is no economic justification for it. As it currently stands, families with an undocumented person living in their household pay more for rent even in subsidized housing. The rent portion is adjusted so that instead of paying around thirty percent of household income for rent, the undocumented person's income is calculated so that their portion of the rent is not subsidized. So effectively this rule does nothing to save HUD any money, but rather only serves the purpose of traumatizing immigrant families. <br/>Historically, access to housing has been used as a tool to control and oppress communities of color, including immigrant communities. If HUD moves forward with this proposed rule then the entire institution will lose its legitimacy as it will be actively harming the communities it exists to protect. There already exists a massive crisis of homelessness that cannot be justified in a country that prides itself on being rich and powerful.

Either result destabilizes families and children in particular, disrupting their education, social and emotional lives.  If we have learned anything, it is that  children without safe housing, stable education, and social and emotional support are much less likely to become healthy, self-supporting and contributing adults.  <br/><br/>I oppose the proposed rule change first on humanitarian grounds.

There may be other countries who want to see the fabric of the U.S. be torn apart, but we should not be participating in that effort.

What it means for those of us who live in urban areas is more human suffering, more crime, more poverty, more displaced children, and more socioeconomic unfairness in our immediate neighborhoods.

As Vermonts leading voice on domestic and sexual violence, the Vermont Network works to promote policies that support victims and survivors of violence to thrive.  We are writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that would prohibit mixed status families from living in Federal and other subsidized housing.<br/><br/>We know that in Vermont and Nationally, domestic violence, sexual violence and housing insecurity are inextricably linked. Housing subsidy is often the key to moving a family out of a domestic violence shelter and into safe, stable housing. The proposed rule could cause more than 100,000 people living in subsidized housing to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. It will also add extra burden on all residents to prove their status, and on housing providers who will need to collect more documentation; leading to a reduction in eligible households receiving subsidy and less housing providers willing to provide affordable housing. This rule is sited as a solution to long wait lists and lack of affordable housing but does nothing to address the underlying causes of these problems and will result in an increase in homeless/housing insecure families in our state and nation.  <br/><br/>Survivors of domestic and sexual violence need more funding going toward the creation of affordable housing, subsidies and support services for them and their children. We urge the Administration to withdraw this rule and focus on policies that would work to make sure that all individuals and families in the United States can thrive in safe and affordable housing. <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This proposal is unnecessary, as there is already a functional policy in place that excludes undocumented immigrants from receiving benefits by prorating the housing benefits received by a household that includes an undocumented immigrant.

These individuals work hard and contribute to our communities.  Some of them lived in Section 8 housing, and if it wasn't for Section 8 housing, they may not have been able to put a roof over their children's heads.  Because they had family members who were undocumented, sometimes those family members got taken advantage of by their employers and were not paid, were underpaid or were not paid workman's comp when they were injured -- Section 8 housing helped them make up for this and be able to take care of their families.  San Diego is a region with extremely high living costs; it's not fair to punish an entire family and put children out on the streets because one or more family member is undocumented.  <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

Many wait-lists are closed for years at a time due to high demand. There are simply not enough mixed status families receiving housing assistance to impact housing assistance wait-lists were they to be denied benefits.<br/><br/>Rather than trying to evict U.S. citizens and their relatives from housing, HUD should be thinking about how they can expand their program to more families, freeing up space on waitlists by getting families the resources they need. This Administration is so clearly interested in reducing access to assistance programs, especially in the racist and xenophobic targeting of immigrant families. They are not interested in expanding programs to other individuals, or other steps would have been taken. Evidence of these clear motivations can be seen by other proposed rule changes to the federal poverty line and the so-called "public charge."<br/><br/>This administration continues to deliberately attempt to undermine the mission of its own federal agencies, promote distrust, and punish beneficiaries.

I will reference an older but still relevant report from the Brookings Institute in 2003, Work and Marriage: The Way to End Poverty and Welfare by Ron Haskins and Isabel Sawhill. The authors found that a two parent (married) household in 2001 was less likely to be in poverty that a single parent or unmarried household which "in part ... reflects the fact that such families increasingly have two earners, lifting them out of poverty whatever the size of their individual paychecks" (page 2). Two parent households or households where a third (in this case undocumented) relative does a significant portion of child care could be devastated by the loss of the childcare provider no longer being in the same household, especially if a lack of affordable housing pushes them further from the home they were forced out of. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This plan affects thousands and thousands of people who are here in this country legally, pay taxes and support our economy.

These types of areas also have transportation barriers for people to access better employment opportunites and healthcare - case in point, Winter Haven, FL. Income-based residences are located there but not near places that offer quick access to pharmacies or grocery stores that offer afforable food. However the one highway in Winter Haven that does have better food options, places hiring and access to public transportation is on the same highway that pulls in tourists from all over the state for Legoland. The people living in the city where this attraction is can't even afford to go there with their families, yet are expected to work in the outskirts of town or within the attraction with low hours and minimum wage. These places are surrounded by empty buildings where businesses relocated or didn't succeed. These are places that can be turned into duplexes or group homes. Partnering with local housing organizations like Habitat for Humanity can help mobilize communuties towards self-sufficiency. Use what you have before placing people on wait lists that they will never get off of. While they're on the waitlists, provide them with courses on financial literacy and interview skills, access to GED courses and entrepreneurship opportunities. There are so many options that can be solved when you work with communities impacted instead of targeting a group of people that want the basic needs we have readily available.

If we had extra housing, money and resources left over and did not know what to do with it then maybe we could have a conversation about it. I have a few family members that are homeless and cannot get assistance because people from outside our country are getting the assistance they desperately need.<br/><br/>I was a victim of this. In 1990 I lived in Sect. 8 housing with my pregnant wife and was forced out of my home of 6 years by undocumented immigrants. I was grandfathered into my complex turning sect. 8 housing and I qualified for assistance. They called me the "gringo" after the entire complex became non-white. My wife was of Mexican descent but her family immigrated legally over a hundred years ago to this great nation. When I went to my local DHS office in San Jose California for assistance on this, I was told by my social worker that "I was white and able to make more money and should not need assistance". This was in the lobby in front of about 30 people. My pregnant wife and I moved because the harassment was not good for the baby. My new apartment manager came knocking on my door one day telling me that an investigator had just came to her because the my social worker started an investigation on us. The apt. manager was very upset because when she tried to tell them about all the families in her complex that were receiving multiple welfare checks to the same addresses and he just ignored her. I she called the DHS headquarters in Sacramento to tell them how upset she was. A couple days later I received a phone call from a person in the Sacramento DHS office telling me how sorry about how I was treated. She looked at my file and said I qualified for cash and food assistance. She asked me if she could assist in getting my wife and I setup. I felt like she was trying to buy me off. As a Christian I have asked God to forgive me for the words I selected in responding to her and still feel bad about it to this day, but in short the answer was no thank you. I told her I would never reach out for assistance ever again. <br/><br/> When I see this conversation going on 29 years later, it just makes me sick.

To think of how my government has spent my tax dollars I have paid over these decades to help people that are not of this country is a complete mismanagement of my tax dollars.

Mixed-status families are households that include both members who are eligible and ineligible for housing assistance based on their immigration status. The rule would force families of mixed immigration status to break up to receive housing assistance, or to forego the assistance altogether.<br/><br/>Around 25,000 households could be impacted nationwide. Among these 25,000 households, approximately 76,000 people are legally eligible for housing benefits, including 55,000 children.<br/><br/>Current regulation already doesn't allow any part of a housing subsidy from HUD to be used for an unqualified immigrant in public housing. Housing authorities pro-rate assistance based on the number of qualified individuals in a household, which reduces the subsidy the household receives.<br/><br/>This means that the rule would not redistribute housing benefits from unqualified individuals to qualified ones.<br/><br/>HUDs own analysis notes that, under the rule, subsidies would need to increase by an estimated $193 to $227 million annually to serve the same number of households.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly oppose this rule.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing.

For example, the agency estimates that 108,000 people would be affected (70% of whom are citizens or permanent residents) and 55,000 children could be displaced. This is not policy in keeping with American traditions of hospitality, family values, or basic common sense. We are called to care for people in unfortunate circumstances with compassion, not heap on trauma after trauma. Who knows what the long-term, lasting costs and harm are for splitting families and forcing children out of their homes, disrupting stability and relational security? This is heart-breaking to think about.<br/><br/>Additionally the agency's analysis notes that this could cost an extra $227 million a year, requiring appropriation, and because of the high cost is more likely to result in a lowering of the quality and quantity of available affordable housing. None of these are the outcomes of good policy-making, particularly considering the stated aims and purpose of HUD.<br/><br/>As the agency itself has noted, a couple of possible amendments to lessen the blow are: 1) to grandfather in existing occupants of subsidized housing and apply the rule only to prospective tenants, 2) to only apply the new rule to the lease holders and not to other tenants.<br/><br/>However perhaps it would be best to scrap this idea altogether.

Will we persist in preaching performative values of freedom and patriotism when our own flag sheds the tears of too many undocumented families struggling to survive? <br/><br/>Immigration and security are contentious debates surrounding America's incredibly divisive, politicized climate. Although many fear the safety of our country as it protects undocumented immigrants and their families, the real, tantalizing threat that undermines our country's security is white nationalism.

This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.

The impact of these changes would be devastating to our most vulnerable households, leaving children as the hardest hit by these changes.  Approximately 55,000 children would loose their eligibility for critical housing assistance, leaving many of them in unstable or even homeless living situations.  And when these households find themselves in such difficult circumstances, there is no support to help to re-stabilize their housing.  This will have a traumatic effect on children.  At a time when we are facing a huge affordable housing crisis across the county, this is not the time to make access to safe, decent, and affordable housing even more difficult for vulnerable persons.<br/><br/>As the law currently stands, persons without legal US status are ineligible for HUD assistance with housing, and housing assistance is therefore pro-rated only for the eligible persons in the household.  Why are you proposing to make citizens and persons with other legal stats ineligible for assistance just because they live with someone who is undocumented?  You are proposing to take access to assistance away for legal persons when the access is already not available for illegal persons.<br/><br/>The fallout from this Proposed Rule will mean that local communities must bear the burden of providing housing assistance to legal persons whom HUD is denying.  Many of these communities will not be able to bear that burden as resources are already stretched or simply not available.  Thus creating or continuing a cycle of poverty in communities where these families reside.<br/><br/>I urge you to consider carefully the harm that this proposed rule will bring across the nation.  And for what benefit?  Please consider carefully the motivations behind this bill--why is HUD proposing to make it even more difficult for vulnerable persons who are legal in the United States to have access to housing?  This goes directly against HUD's mission.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

I am submitting a statement of opposition on the recent proposed HUD rule that would prohibit mixed status families from living in public housing and Section 8 programs and would evict those mixed status families currently living in public housing and Section 8 units.  <br/>La Clinica is a large Community Health Center with 35+ locations throughout the East Bay Area of California.  La Clinica is a health care provider serving more than 90,000 children, families and adults with more than 360,000 medical, dental, behavioral health and vision care visits.  La Clinica additionally provides tens of thousands of enabling, preventive, community health education, and social determinants of health support services to our patients.  La Clinica predominately serves a low income - highly immigrant population that could be affected by this proposed rule.  <br/>There has been a long standing correlation with economic, psycho-social, built environments, such as housing, and community-based factors that impact the health of individuals and populations.<br/>The results of La Clinicas assessment of the social and economic needs of our patients and community, indicate the top issue that our patients face on a day-to-day-basis is Housing and Fear of Losing their Housing.  Results of our Evidence Based Assessment Tool, (Protocol Responding to and Assessing Patients Assets, Risks, and Experiences or PRAPARE;) 94% of our families currently have housing, but 57% of our patients are worried about losing their housing.   Specifically related to Housing, patients have shared they feel at risk of losing housing due to high costs and life changes; multiple family members or acquaintances live in one unit to be able to afford housing.  Low income housing is more often unavailable, and/or very limited with long waiting lists for Public Housing and Section 8.  Patients stated fears of being evicted if they report repairable and even deplorable conditions to their landlords or the authorities.  Some families have limited means to demonstrate income to be able to rent/lease on their own.  Senior Housing and some low income housing require demonstrating SS#.  High housing costs affect other aspects (food, transportation, utilities, health care &amp; medications) on a familys budget and their well-being.  <br/>There is a higher rate of stress and well-being with our families concerned about housing.  Housing status impacts the patients health status with 83% of our patients responding to housing concerns showing higher levels of stress.  We see a correlation with stressed patients and higher rates of diabetes, hypertension and depression.  <br/>This proposed Rule affecting Public housing and Section 8 restricting and evicting mixed status families would have a devastating impact on our families and especially young children.  Unstable housing is a factor for an Adverse Childhood Event (ACE.)  One of our Doctors stated Housing insecurity is the foundation of many health problems for children and interferes with the ability of parents to keep them clean, schooled and well fed.  The lack of a stable home - with beds, a kitchen and a bathroom  creates <br/>emotional and psychological insecurity that will adversely impact on basic health and well-being of any child. <br/>On behalf of the tens of thousands of families, children and community residents we serve, we encourage HUD not to take steps and make decisions that negatively impact the health and well-being of your youngest and most vulnerable residents and their families.  It is only through collaboration and partnership across sector with service and policy, like housing and health that we can make a positive impact on the health disparities we see in our communities and create a better future for our children. <br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Jane Garcia<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Good afternoon,<br/><br/>I am writing today in opposition of this rule change.

These families consist of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents who may have a member that is ineligible for housing assistance due to their immigration status. While these families are currently pro-rated to only provide assistance for those members who are eligible, these proposed changes would instead require the family to remove the ineligible member (which is most likely a parent or income provider) or be evicted from their home. Because of this, over 100,000 people are at risk of being evicted with 55,000 of them being children. <br/>Funders Together to End Homelessness San Diego is a group of private and public funders who pool and align our resources to provide flexible funding, convene stakeholders, educate other funders, and advocate for San Diego to implement solutions that are proven to end homelessness.  Since its inception, Funders Together has granted more than $1.9 million to end homelessness for the more than 9,000 individuals living on the streets, in cars or in emergency shelters in San Diego. We oppose the proposed rulemaking for the reasons below. <br/>This rule will exacerbate our national affordable housing and homelessness crises.<br/>Funders in California have made tremendous investments in affordable housing and decreasing homelessness. Yet, the proposed rule would evict tens of thousands of immigrant families. According to HUD, 25,000 mixed status families will need to decide to separate or forgo housing assistance.  Thirty-seven percent of these families live in California. Due to our scarcity of housing resources, many of these families will not be able to find affordable housing to move into, and will end up homeless.  It is unconscionable that the federal government will be forcing families out of their homes and onto the streets.<br/><br/>We believe evicting families and children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents from homes and putting them at risk of experiencing homelessness is indecent and illegal.<br/>This proposal is against Funders Together to End Homelessness San Diegos values of racial equity. This change in the rule would mainly affect people of color, who are already at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness and currently make up a disproportional percentage of the homeless population. In order to end homelessness, we must stop harmful legislation on these communities and instead focus on solutions that center and prioritize them.<br/>Funders Together to End Homelessness San Diego stands behind supporting and protecting our immigrant communities. We call on the Administration to disregard the proposed changes and to work with philanthropy through public-private partnerships to ensure we are creating equitable systems that will end homelessness for all.<br/>The Rule Change is costly and will decrease the quality of housing assistance.<br/>HUD estimates that there will be $200M in added costs for HUD to replace mixed status families with all-eligible families, an amount which does not even include enforcement.  In order to pay for that shortfall, HUD says the agency could pay for this by reducing the quantity and quality of assistant housing in response to higher costs for everyone.  In the midst of a housing crisis, we need more housing not less, and we need better quality of housing to ensure that families are not living in unsafe, substandard conditions.<br/>This rule will adversely impact the existing HUD homeless assistance programs. The rule will require onerous documentation requirements that will significantly increase costs to public housing authorities. Plus, these additional administrative burdens to the housing assistance programs are likely to reduce the number of landlords who want to participate in Section 8 and other housing programs.<br/>For the above reasons, we strongly urge HUD to withdraw the proposed mixed status rule. If you have any questions regarding this subject, please contact me by phone at (858) 875-3331 or by email at amy@sdgrantmakers.org. Thank you for your consideration. <br/>Regards, <br/><br/>Amy Denhart<br/>Director<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Already a crisis, homelessness will increase dramatically with HUD's proposed Mixed-Status Rule.  I am outraged by the proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>I live between Annapolis and Baltimore, where the current subsidized housing situation is both inadquate and deplorable.  Kicking families out of housing is a misdirected effort.  I don't believe people in America have lost all compassion.  A simple, decent place to live. That is what people want. More effort by HUD should be in renovating existing housing to bring it up to livable conditions and creating more housing that is a mix of subsidized and non-subsidized rents.  This has been shown to be the most successful. Please move the ship in the right direction. We can do better. We are better than this proposal suggests.<br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Donald Trump,<br/>Why are you doing this?

The citizenship status of one family member -- who may the parent of other family members in the home -- should not affect the right to safe housing of all members in that home.

The proposed rule will cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. A significant number of these families include individuals and children who trying to rebuild their lives after being seriously impacted by domestic violence.  These children will be further traumatized if they are separated from their families or forced to become homeless to remain with their non-citizen family members.<br/><br/>LACLJ is a non-profit organization which has been providing culturally competent free legal services to low-income residents of Los Angeles and their families for over 40 years.  LACLJs mission is to secure justice for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and empower them to create their own future.  LACLJs immigration work supports survivors of trauma in obtaining stability by representing them in their VAWA, U non-immigrant status, T non-immigrant status, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, and Adjustment of Status petitions, among others.  LACLJ has represented hundreds of individuals who have applied for immigration relief based on having survived domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, abuse, abandonment, neglect, and/or other violent crimes.  LACLJ can thus speak to the extreme difficulty the proposed HUD rule will bring to the particularly vulnerable segment of the immigrant community we serve, namely undocumented survivors of violence.  LACLJ staff has witnessed how the ability to obtain federally-subsidized housing has improved the long-term stability of the families we serve and kept them from returning to an abusive situation. Access to affordable housing is critical to ensuring long-term safety and stability for these families, particularly when considering that we live in a city that is experiencing a serious housing shortage and homelessness crisis.<br/><br/>Please see our attached letter with further information about why LACLJ strongly opposes the proposed "mixed status family" rule and requests that HUD withdraw it immediately.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">It's unacceptable to essentially remove an estimated 55,000 children or 25,000 families from the only homes available to them. <br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Secretary Ben Carson,<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule that would prohibit mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing.

These families will be forced into unstable housing situations, whether that is couchsurfing, living in overcrowded housing situations, homeless shelters, on the streets or other places unfit for long term human habitation such as emergency rooms. This will inevitably lead to the deterioration of health and wellbeing, and will cost the medical system more money in the long run. In addition, the wellbeing of families are linked.

This proposed rule change is based on hate of immigrants (documented, undocumented, citizen and non-citizen) and not on evidence that harm is actually being done to the United States, that significant resources are being diverted from the purpose of providing housing to low-income families or that people are breaking the current law.<br/><br/>2. By HUD estimates this proposed rule change will result in the eviction, and probable subsequent homelessness, of about 108,000 residents, 76,000 of the total are low-income American citizens nationwide, 55,000 of those citizens are children and as such are entitled to those benefits.  This rule change is an instance of throwing the baby out with the bath water.  Estimates are that nationwide there are about 25,000 households living in subsidized housing that have both immigrant and citizen members.  Evicting 75,000 residents (including 55,000 children) in order to remove 33,000 immigrants is cruel and does not seem fair, reasonable or rational.<br/><br/>3. HUD is supposed to help low-income families afford housing, not increase homelessness.  It is unlikely those evicted will be able to find affordable living arrangements.  Per U.S. government criteria, housing is considered affordable if housing costs are at or below 30% of family income. Making it more difficult to afford housing, is not only ia scarcity of low cost housing in the private market, for the past 20+ years the cost of rent has risen much faster than income, which makes it even more difficult for low-income families to afford housing. Per the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities there are still 23 million people in 10.7 million low-income American households pay(ing) more than half their income for rent.<br/><br/>4. By your own calculations this proposed rule will cost the federal government more than the current rule.  Given that all household members would be eligible for benefits, government costs will increase an additional $193 million to $227 million a year. <br/><br/>5. In my opinion, it is immoral to make people homeless (which this proposed rule will do) when it is not necessary, and when the US can afford to help low income people with their housing costs.<br/><br/>6. Finally, to further underscore how this cruel rule is designed to harm immigrants and not to improve availability of low-income housing, this proposed rule affects only a small percentage (0.5%) of the 5.2 million households currently receiving assistance of federally subsidized housing for low income families.  Continuing to allow this small number of mixed immigrant families to live in subsidized housing is not going to help Make certain our scarce public resources help those who are legally entitled to" those resources.   In actuality, it is not true that there are scare resources.   America has abundant resources to provide support for low-income families if it wanted to do so.  If the US can afford $686 billion in 2019 for defense and to give $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, it most certainly can afford more than the $52.7 billion allocated in 2018 for HUD, and improve access to low-income housing.<br/><br/>I am asking that the proposed rule change not be implemented because it is mean-spirited, trivial, and is counter to the goals and values of HUD and this country.<br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/>James D.

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>Communities around the US are working hard to stymie eviction rates in an effort to relieve overtaxed homeless shelter and emergency response systems, yet this move would would evict thousands of extremely vulnerable families - many, if not most of whom will not have another housing option and will have no choice but to enter the shelter system. The same regulations that evicted these families will then present one more barrier for those families to ever exit homelessness. <br/><br/>While this proposed rule would send thousands of children who are U.S. Citizens or have legal status into homelessness, replacing households of mixed immigration status with households of only eligible residents will require HUD to provide full subsidies for each resident, costing HUD at least $193 million and likely with an equivalent loss of HUD subsidized housing. Not only would thousands of legal residents and US citizens become homeless as a direct result of this rule, HUD would not be able to serve the equivalent number of households in exchange.

It also suggests a fundamental lack of respect for HUMAN RIGHTS, as HOUSING is A HUMAN RIGHT. Sec. Carson's suggestion that Congress fix this by simply 'coming up with immigration reform' is truly laughable given that under the ironclad grip of his President and his Senate Majority Leader all but judicial nominations seem to scrape through.

If there are few projected benefits for low income U.S. citizens, then it seems as if this rule was proposed under a guise, and is inherently anti-immigrant. It is highly unlikely that mixed status families would split up as a result of this rule's implementation, as familial values would not allow for such actions. If entire households face eviction, this could result in a rise in homelessness across the nation - which costs between $20,000 - $50,000 per individual per year. I strongly encourage the current administration to explore alternative rule changes that would not have such significant impact on our immigrant communities. HUD offered several suggestions, including grandfathering in current mixed status families and only apply the rule moving forward, and only applying the rule to households in which the leaseholder is undocumented.

Currently housing stipends do not go to ineligible immigrants. Mixed-status households receive housing stipends for only the eligible household members.  <br/><br/>Administratively, the rule would be extremely costly to implement and to sustain, and its effect on the Department of Housings bottom line would be disastrous. The Department of Housing and Urban Developments own impact analysis estimates that putting it into effect would cost between $12 to $17 million.  If mixed status immigrant households leave the public housing and supportive housing programs, HUD will have to spend over an extra $200 million extra dollars a year on new stipends  funds that the Department does not have.  The result will be a less efficient Department, lower quality housing, and fewer housing b beneficiaries.  This is not a reasonable scenario.<br/><br/>Mixed status households would have to choose between keeping their families intact and having a safe roof over their heads. This is a choice no government should force on families. Households would be evicted at a moment when there is a national housing crisis. The likelihood of finding alternative affordable housing is very low.  <br/><br/>By HUDs analysis, most (70%) of the tenants who would be affected by the rule are US citizens.  The rule is discriminatory, in that it effectively penalizes citizens for having immigrant relatives.   <br/><br/>This rule would punish children. HUD estimates that 55,000 children would be affected. The resulting housing instability and homelessness this rule would cause would have longterm ill effects on those childrens longterm physical, psychological, educational growth and futures.  In addition, the repercussions of this harm will be felt throughout our communities and our economy, with lower productivity, higher health care costs, increased crime rates that would affect the entire society. The American Public Health Association study U.S. Housing Insecurity and the Health of Very Young Children, emphasizes the importance of stable housing in child development: It found that  [H]ousing insecurity is associated with poor health, lower weight, and developmental risk among young children.

I oppose the rule change in the strongest possible terms. It would be easy to critique the proposed rule on the basis of its not so thinly veiled attempts to play into and/or stoke increasingly ascendant anti-immigrant sentiments.  Similarly, as a researcher with more than a decade of experience conducting applied research on the causes, consequences and solutions to housing insecurity and homelessness, I could offer a lengthy critique of the propose rule from the standpoint of its likely adverse effects on the health, educational outcomes well-being of the children who will be made homeless by it.  However, I wish to comment on the inherent problem with the proposed rule from a more basic and less ideologically divisive standpoint: simply put, the proposed rule fails to meet a number of fundamental criteria for good public policy.   <br/><br/>From a fiscal standpoint, the proposed rule would make less efficient use of taxpayer resources.  Indeed, HUDs own Regulatory Impact Analysis of the proposed rule published on April 15, 2019 indicates that that implementing the rule change would result in increased costs to HUD of between $193 to $217 million dollars per year.  As the Regulatory Impact Analysis makes clear, to cover this additional cost, HUD would require more resources from American taxpayers, or would cut the number of assisted households to make up for the increased costs.  Either way, the outcome is an increased cost per household served by HUD programs, which is the precise opposite of what new regulations should strive to do. <br/><br/>From an operational standpoint, the proposed rule would increase the administrative burden associated with the HUD programs affected by the proposed rule.  Specifically, evicting mixed-status families currently in HUD housing would introduce new obligations for local public housing authorities, and by HUDs own estimate, would come at a cost of between $12.8 and $17.4 million dollars. Here again, by introducing new regulatory burden, the proposed rule would deliver an outcome that is inconsistent with good public policy. <br/><br/>Finally, the proposed rule runs contrary to broadly shared American values that ought to be embedded in every public policy decision.  In its own Regulatory Impact Analysis of the proposed rule, HUD acknowledges that some households affected by the proposed rule would become homeless.  Given the strong and consistent evidence of the negative health, social, educational, and economic outcomes associated with homelessness, this outcome should be seen as entirely unacceptable from a moral standpoint.  Families served by the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), who would include a military veteran, could be among those affected.  Forcing military veterans and their family members into homelessness is fundamentally un-American. <br/><br/>In short, the proposed rule would make for incredibly poor public policy.  The American public and those residing in HUD-assisted housing, in particular, deserve better.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Thomas Byrne, Ph.D.<br/>Assistant Professor of Social Welfare Policy<br/>Boston University School of Social Work<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">The proposed rule on evicting families that include non-citizens from public housing would threaten the stability of American citizens and their family members.

Instead of trying to kick people out of their home, the administration should be focused on providing affordable housing to all. Many American citizens are on the wait list for housing assistance because housing is too expensive. The proposal does nothing to address the affordable housing crisis; the rule takes away assistance from one set of eligible U.S. citizens and immigrants and gives it to another.

This rule goes directly against the purpose of HUD as well as the values of the U.S. government and people; and, furthermore, (by HUD's own admission) creates unnecessary expenses for the government. <br/><br/>Documented U.S. residents - approximately 55,000 of them children - would be at risk of homelessness. Not only unethical, this is antithetical to HUD's mission to help Americans meet their housing needs. Additionally, this proposal is discriminatory towards U.S. citizens and legal residents, as it targets those who come from "mixed" families of documented and undocumented residents. HUD commits itself to affordable housing free of discrimination. This defies that commitment.<br/><br/>This proposed rule comes at a time when the U.S. is scrambling to remedy the Trump administration's policy of family separation at the border, which has been notably and significantly unpopular among U.S. residents and condemned by the American Psychiatric Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the NAACP - among many other important religious, medical and human rights organizations. While not equivalent in practice to that policy, this rule would put families at risk of separating (in order for the documented residents to maintain housing, presumably many would experience pressure for undocumented residents to leave) and create undue psychiatric trauma for children. <br/><br/>Any rule or policy that inflicts trauma upon children produces irreparable harm. As we know from the CDC-Kaiser Adverse Childhood Experiences Study, abuse, neglect and trauma in childhood increase the potential for risky health behaviors, chronic health conditions and early death. (Notably, a lot of these risks can also create financial burden on the U.S. government, particularly in terms of resources for federal healthcare programs.)<br/><br/>HUD admits that this rule would cost the government as much as $227 million dollars per year. HUD also admits that due to increase costs, the quantity and quality of affordable housing would possibly be reduced. The increase in potential expenditure as well as decrease in housing availability should, in itself, be enough evidence that this rule should never have been proposed. Certainly, it should not even be considered as a plausible solution if HUD's own evidence displays otherwise. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule to prohibit mixed status families from living in subsidized housing. This proposed change unjustly punishes mixed status immigrant families that are only exercising their ability access subsidized housing under current federal law. <br/><br/>I ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn. Family unity should be considered a fundamental value and component of our immigration system. The proposed rule will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness.<br/><br/>The Aging Population<br/><br/>Federal housing assistance programs provide vital support to 1.9 million older adults who would otherwise be unable to afford the cost of shelter. Seniors with fixed incomes are especially at risk of serious harm if they live in mixed status families and lose rental assistance due to the rule because they have such limited resources to spend on other basic needs, including food, medicine, transportation, and clothing. The proposed rule would also make it impossible for many intergenerational families to live together and share resources that enable them to succeed. It ignores the critical roles many grandparents play in caring for their grandchildren and other family members, as well as the role adult children play in caring for their aging parents and relatives.<br/><br/>In Illinois, 18% of people receiving federal rental assistance are seniors. Overall, federal rental assistance helps 80,600 of Illinois seniors age in place.<br/><br/>Many seniors who do not receive rental assistance, such as those who would be evicted if the proposed rule goes into effect, face a significant shortage of affordable rental housing. In Illinois, based on U.S. Census data from 2016, 30% of households with a member aged 65 to 79 are severely cost burdened, paying more than half their income for housing.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the proposed rule adds new documentation requirements that will be particularly burdensome on older adults. The proposed rule will require all U.S. citizens to provide proof of citizenship, and will also require noncitizens 62 years old or over to provide additional documentation of their immigration status. Older individuals face many challenges in getting this kind of documentation, including difficulties getting to government offices to replace lost records, coming up with the funds to replace these records, and some may have never been issued these documents in the first place.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I oppose this regulation.

Please accept my comments and opposition in the strongest possible terms to the rule change that will threaten the health and well-being of families of immigrants, communities of color, and citizen and noncitizen children. <br/><br/>I am a physician and Instructor at Harvard Medical School, and a member of the Advisory Board at Childrens HealthWatch, a nonpartisan network of pediatricians and public health researchers committed to improving the health of young children and their families by informing policies that address an alleviate economic hardships. Through my work with Childrens HealthWatch and a physician in family shelters at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, I have seen that for children to thrive, they need safe, stable homes their parents are able to afford without sacrificing other basic needs. <br/><br/>I myself am an immigrant and for immigrant families, family unity is paramount. Forcing immigrant families, who have come to this country as part of the American Dream, to pursue a better life, make the choice between family unity and the health of their children, is particularly cruel.<br/><br/>I am a pediatrician and have deep expertise in family and child homelessness, both as a clinician and as a researcher. As a shelter-based health care provider, I have seen the physical and psychiatric effects of the trauma of homelessness on hundreds of families. The negative effect of homelessness and housing instability affects school performance, hospital visits, behavior, and overall health. In my experience, the impacts extend beyond childhood and negatively affect whether children reach their overall potential, and how well individuals can contribute to society as adults. To purposefully condemn thousands of children to this fate, whether citizens or not, is unconscionable.<br/><br/>The proposed changes to section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 will threaten the health of children, including citizen children, and likely have lasting effects on the health of families and communities across our country. The changes proposed are specifically designed to force families to make choices that will harm their childrens health; mixed status families would have to make the excruciating decision to face eviction or separate as a family in order to retain housing. Both options will have lasting negative impacts on child and family health.<br/><br/>The changes outlined in this proposed rule are harmful to children, particularly children of color, in this country. Evicting families or forcing them to separate will not only harm childrens health today, but well into the future as well. We need policies that expand, not reduce, access to stable homes for families with children in order to ensure all children have opportunities to be healthy and reach their highest potential. For these reasons, I urge the Department to immediately withdraw this harmful proposal.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/> <br/>Avik Chatterjee, MD, MPH<br/>Physician, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program<br/>Instructor, Harvard Medical School<br/><br/>  Perreira K, Hirokazu Y, Oberlander Y.

The only way our nation can fulfill its promise is by prioritizing the wellbeing of children. Throwing tens of thousands of children onto the street is not progress: it's cruelty.

As a professor, I have taught many students in mixed-status families; they experience trauma from the stress of their families losing benefits or being separated.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. <br/>This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.  We Americans are hospitable people. We use kindness and assistance in our dealings with others especially who are dealing with challenges in their everyday existence. These are our values.  Then, if this is who we Americans are, why is this administration creating unnecessary roadblocks for immigrant families?  Why is this administration reversing the age-old practice of helping immigrant families settle together in proper housing?  <br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. <br/>This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.  Why is this administration blatantly discriminating against people receiving HUD assistance by creating more roadblocks. <br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity.

EVERY single one!  Even the members of our First Nations walked across the land bridge before it turned into the Bering Strait. <br/><br/>And, because every one of us is an immigrant, HOW can any of us even consider such despicable actions and treatment toward other immigrants, let alone actually DO THEM TO OUR FELLOW IMMIGRANTS?!<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule that would prohibit mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing. I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing.

There is no doubt about this.

It will cause increases in a host of negative social behaviors like substance use, women and girls being coerced into predatory sex work, and domestic violence.

Family unity is important for a myriad of social and health reasons, and evidence has shown that the stable presence of a supportive caregiver can buffer the ill effects from adverse life effects in children.  Any policy that serves to weaken that bond or remove that presence is likely to worsen long-term health outcomes for children, especially those facing additional vulnerabilities such as poverty.  <br/><br/>Furthermore, as a parent myself I understand the ways that family unity is important for the health of adults.

Many US citizen and legal resident children will be affected by this rule in those instances where at least one parent is undocumented. If approved, those children will also have to vacate their home and many will end up on the streets, which will then create a terrible homelessness problem as well as a health concern. Many children (and adults) with no roof over their heads will have health problems or will be unable to care for their health problems if already sick, this in turn will overpopulate the hospitals and medical centers and create a back log of medical services, possibly even lack them, or afford good quality services in many communities. This can ultimately become a state and even national health crisis where all other Americans will be at risk of disease. But more importantly, these children will struggle in many areas of their life, medically, physically, academically, socially and civically. They will not have a good and/or strong foundation and a chance at life as these children will eventually grow up and be dependent on additional government services if they lack means.

The eligibility for a household with documented children has been a lifeline for families to exit homelessness and secure healthy, stable housing. This ends a family's housing crisis, which allows neighborhoods to stabilize, children to thrive and parents to get back on their feet so they can effectively care for their households. The report on this proposed measure further indicated that if mixed status households receive less subsidy on average so made to give up housing assistance for those with eligible status will hurt our programs and systems, rather than helping as many in need as possible. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">See attached file(s)</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule to prohibit families whose members have mixed status, where some qualify for public housing assistance and some do not based on their immigration status, from living in public housing.

Below are some points and questions that should be taken into consideration.  <br/><br/>Implementation<br/>- Getting documentation to demonstrate citizenship is complex and can cause several barriers for case managers that already have challenges gathering necessary paperwork . Will HUD representatives be asked to determine citizenship eligibility? How will they know what documentation to look for and how to confirm a person's status?<br/>- The implementation of this Rule would set and president and lead to further regulations for other HUD programs. <br/>- Who will pay for this? How is putting persons on the street any more affordable than providing housing? <br/>- How will this impact persons that are in the country legally, but do not have citizenship? <br/><br/>Eviction<br/>- Families will be broken up if non-citizens are forced out of housing.<br/>- Forced evictions will cause trauma to children and family members.<br/>- What is the plan for persons that are evicted- where will they go? <br/><br/>Homelessness<br/>- There will be a sharp influx in the number of persons who are homeless.

The proposed changes also still incorporate if that was present before in the rules as originally placed into service an exemption from documenting the eligibility of any person age 62 or older. The many cases where contention for housing solutions in affordable and then voucher sustained cases are going to be age 62 and older. Exemptions then will prove to not alleviate how housing for those qualified at age 62 and now older will still remain substantially below what is needed. It is statistically relevant to collect any age 62 or older verified statuses as well to determine the scope of the population in excess of what is or was never supposed to be allowed. Further when resolving how to remove not qualified occupants and then pertaining to how the goal of age 62 was to save them how they may occupy the better solutions forcing those qualified into the dungeon concept is how the palace provided to those not qualified is easily constructed by not having had the entitlement. For some, frankly, has been years of undeserved enrichment at the cost of injuring Americans by displacing their rights to obtain assistance and then in the result being forced to accept reduced in scale of comparables more stringent accommodations and then the worst choices in real estate complexes than those not qualified. The handling of policy is that any U.S. citizen has the right to select the best solution available when available and they are qualified and any in those solutions at any age not qualified must be relocated if determined to be exempt from being denied any occupied HUD services to any available other solution or be transferred to their countrys support system or to any state provided and paid for alternative respective of human rights being assured.  The ranking for qualified also needs to rank among those to assure U.S citizens are assured best choices every time. Any U.S. citizen born that status and then usually for the best test of parents like that may never be forced to accept less than provided to any other HUD qualified category not a U.S. citizen or approved in any comparison or it is personal injury in being forced to lose value entitled. Verification of the proper documentation status for all age 62 and older is in the public interest and in policy determinations absolutely required to know how policy must be addressed.  Apart for the issue of verification of all age cases the policy to direct verification of all ages must be commenced immediately if not known already to align to the knowns to know and this may not require any changes to the proposed rules but application of proper inspector general provisions. In this regard the goal is not to just phase in a changed rule basis aligned to the specific period when such practices are presumed but the requirement to assess rapidly the scope of the injury being caused and then be in practice to immediately being able to align to the proper implementations. The proposed rule is opening up the opportunity to address proper review and alignment obligations for any prior exemption for age 62 if that establishment of the exemption had been contextually relevant and for the cause to amend the rules to allow this to be properly redressing of the public rights to have assured that only qualified U.S citizens are able to find assistance and obtain it when needed. Removing the age 62 exemption overall is objectively a better solution in formation of steps to address proper implementation of entitlement assurance.  The in parallel right of any U.S. citizen to know when injury is occurring is about properly being able to inspect or ascertain who is not qualified and in possession of needed units of housing needed so that the right to occupy the unit of solution can also be about due process then (Requesting a judge inquiry and finding is in the legality of being proper due process).  Discrimination has many edges. Housing authorities in any category may not hold secrets that cause citizens to remain homeless while those not qualified contain citizen's rights to housing. ____<br/><br/>My comment in verbatim above replicated is as already entered for the record by sending it via email to HUD responsible individuals and to the HUD OIG comment electronically  provided message drop.<br/><br/>Statement and comment entered for the record this day June 12, 2019<br/><br/>Michael L.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.Please don't support Trumps cruel policies. As a person of color,what are you doing to support racial equality when you go along with these rules that target minorities and threaten to end their assistance for housing?! Please serve the people and fight to secure the funding to house our most vulnerable population.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing.

Currently, mixed status families receive prorated housing subsidies so that ineligible family members do not receive any housing assistance. The proposal would require all subsidized housing residents who are not elderly to have their immigration status verified.  Families with members who are deemed ineligible will be evicted from subsidized housing after 18 months or sooner. <br/><br/>This rule is needlessly cruel to immigrant children and families and does nothing to increase housing supply for low-income families.

People with stable living situations are far more likely to maintain jobs, meaningfully contribute to society and give back to their communities. I've known many undocumented people in my life and I can guarantee that nobody wants to live a life in fear, but our system is so broken it takes most people years to gain legal citizenship. When people are fleeing war torn and corrupt countries, sometimes leaving without documentation is their only chance at survival. Anybody trying to save the lives of their children or loved ones would do the same, even if it means they will have to be undocumented in a foreign country. Some of the kindest, most compassionate people I know have undocumented family members. Don't punish children just because their parents were left with no other options.

Families with members who are deemed ineligible will be evicted from subsidized housing after 18 months or sooner. The proposal would also threaten housing assistance for millions of households that remain eligible for assistance and consist only of U.S. citizens or eligible immigrants. It would require tens of thousands of housing agencies and private property owners to collect documents proving the citizenship of more than 9 million assisted residents who have already attested, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens, as well as the citizenship of future applicants for assistance. And it would require some 120,000 elderly immigrants to submit documents indicating their status. If individuals are unable to produce these documents in the timeframe permitted, they can lose their housing assistance and, in turn, lose their homes. The magnitude of homelessness in this country is already critical. This rule would make a horrible situation even worse, creating even further stress on the affordable housing market, in which we already face a significant national deficit, as well as our homeless service providers across the country. It could also place further fiscal burden on our nation's schools as they struggle to serve newly homeless children and families that this rule change would create as required by federal statute. <br/>Please consider not only the emotional impact of this type of rule change on those affected but also the fiscal unintended consequences on the other systems which would then need to step in to assist those displaced by this rule change. <br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule to prohibit mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing.

Children need a safe supportive family environment to grow and develop their maximal potential.

This ruling will cause unnecessary stressors for thousands of children who are US citizens. Families will feel forced to stay together and seek other places to live or to separate. In their search for other housing they may very well be homeless for long periods of time. Being homeless will not help our children thrive. Furthermore, leaving affordable housing will place an additional financial burden for the families, which will add to the stressors and decrease opportunities for the children.  The ruling does not address the housing crisis. Family members who are undocumented do not get subsidized housing. The ruling does not fix any problems but will certainly negatively affect the health and wellbeing of our children. Please do not separate our children from their family.

At the time I was unaware of the May 23, 2019 Executive Order Memorandum on Enforcing the Legal Responsibilities of Sponsors of Aliens.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-enforcing-legal-responsibilities-sponsors-aliens/.<br/><br/>I write now to amend my comment to note that the plain language of 8 U.S.C.  1611 makes it clear that the benefits governed by the NRPM are means tested benefits for the purposes of that section, except to the extent beneficiaries were grandfathered in when that part of Title 8 was passed in 1996. 8 U.S.C.  1611(b)(E). This potentially changes the analysis of the regulation for multiple reasons.  <br/><br/>First, the RIA did note that the household income of non-mixed households would likely decrease following the rule change, because ineligible member income is counted for the purposes of calculating household income.  As the Executive Order and Title 8 (8 U.S.C.  1631) state, an aliens income, notwithstanding any other provision of law, is to be deemed to include the sponsors income.  This should be noted, and suggests a need to codify procedures in the proposed rule to comply with this accounting, although it will likely not affect the underlying cost-benefit analysis.  To the extent sponsor income was not considered under the prior regime, it would exacerbate the magnitude of the change to a new per-household subsidy: for the reasons noted in my prior comment, this shift is a policy decision that should not have any impact on the efficiency of benefit delivery.<br/><br/>Second, and more substantially, the new Executive Order suggests a need to consider procedures for enforcing 8 U.S.C. 1183a(b)(1)(A), consistent with any applicable regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.  The Department should consider the NPRM as an appropriate vehicle for discharging its obligations under the new Executive Order and under statute.  <br/><br/>At a minimum, as I noted in my prior comment, the Department should consider a list of documents for verifying eligibility.  For eligible aliens, this list should include a copy of the Section 213A affidavit of support.  This information is already necessary for determining household income, and would facilitate the Departments obligation to request reimbursement from the sponsor if necessary.<br/><br/>Respectfully submitted,<br/>Andrew R.

The safety and healing of trauma-survivors are the top priorities of MLEA, and we are committed to providing services which reflect the values and culture of the clients that we serve.

Traumatized and vulnerable, survivors are also often indigent and face numerous challenges to their basic well-being. As a result, ready access to safe, affordable housing is critical to their ability to flee abusive homes. For some, their basic survival hangs in the balance. <br/>If the proposed rule goes into effect, ineligible survivors and their eligible children who are trying to escape violent homes will be trapped in a false choicehomelessness or remaining with an abuser. Those already living in subsidized housing who are evicted and forced to return to a violent home will face an even greater risk to their safety. It is commonly known that the danger to a victim increases once she escapes, with one estimate noting a 75% increase in violence for at least two years following an escape.<br/>I ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn.

This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance. Hud has wasted too much money on nonsense things such as furniture and God only knows what else. This agency under Ben Carson has become dysfunctional for people that actually need it and has like most of Trump administrative personnel become their own personal bank account. This need to stop. We want immigrant families to have a decent place to live so they can have a good start in a new life. <br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Billie Weaver<br/>764 W Placita Las Tapas  Sahuarita, AZ 85629-8413</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

I have seen my family and loved ones living in poverty and relying on quality affordable housing to resist and survive the pressures brought upon them by poverty. Through living together in places we call home, we have relied on each other for social support and connectedness that serves as the key factor to working towards a world where liberation is attainable and poverty is eradicated. The acceptance and sense of belonging that is provided in places we call home is limitless, and not exclusively provided to only a select few. We view every person for their humanity and disregard socially-imposed labels (e.g. undocumented) due to faulty law and policy. This is particularly true when you consider how law and policy in this country operates in an ahistorical and irresponsible manner that ignores the tradition of exploitation and suffering the United States has caused to people globally, both domestically and abroad, which has created the conditions that require people to migrate.    <br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development.

We urge the rule to be withdrawn in its entirety, and that HUDs long-standing regulations remain in effect.<br/><br/>Central City Concern is a non-profit direct service organization that provides integrated primary and behavioral health care, supportive and affordable housing, and employment services to people impacted by homelessness in the Oregon Tri-County area. <br/><br/>At Central City Concern we area a partner organization to our local housing authority known as Home Forward. We operate both project-based units and house families with housing choice vouchers in our properties. This rule would require additional administrative burden and financial losses to vacate units or risk losing long-term subsidies that have and could continue to serve hundreds of households over the life of the properties. We are not in the business of evicting low-income residents, but this rule would ask us to violate our mission and values and to betray our communities. With a history of disinvestment in public housing, HUD and the housing authorities need partnerships from organizations like ours. <br/>Although HUD contends that the proposed rule is a means of addressing the waitlist crisis faced by a majority of Public Housing Authorities nationwide, at Central City Concern we do not believe you can address the shortage of affordable housing by making more families homeless. In fact, HUD is banking on this, noting in their regulatory impact analysis that HUD expects that fear of the family being separated would lead to prompt evacuation by most mixed households, whether that fear is justified. Therefore, this rule would effectively evict as many as 108,000 individuals in mixed status families (in which nearly 3 out of 4 are eligible for assistance) from public housing, Section 8, and other programs covered by the proposed rule. These mass evictions and departures from housing assistance will cause increased rates of homelessness and unstable housing among an already vulnerable population.<br/><br/>We recognize that the proposed rule is a part of the current administrations coordinated attack on immigrant families. We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of sufficient funding and a continued pattern of cutting funding to housing programs. Again this year the administration proposed another cut to HUD programs. We value the work of congress in reversing course last year to stabilizing funding, but a major increase in housing resources is needed. Approximately 1 in 4 families that qualify for HUD housing programs actually get access, attacking families already living on the margins will not change this dismal access rate; only a major investment in HUDs housing programs can really change the tide of access to end homelessness.<br/><br/>With regard to addressing homelessness, the proposed rule is in direct conflict with federal policy priorities of ending homelessness and federal mandates for states to provide certain assistance and programs to everyone. For example, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) has prioritized ending and preventing homelessness among families with children, regardless of immigration status. USICHs mission is to affirmatively remove barriers to housing access, all while acknowledging that communities that are diversein their demographics, in their needs, in their geographic characteristics, in their progress to date, in their resources, in their infrastructure, in their housing markets, and in many other ways. The proposed rule directly contradicts this policy goal by erecting additional barriers to housing access. Furthermore, the rule is in conflict with the National Affordable Housing Acts edict to ensure that every American family be able to afford a decent home in a suitable environment.<br/><br/>Access to stable and affordable housing is a basic platform for family and community health, well-being, and dignity, and our communities thrive when everyone has access to a high quality home. Immigrants and their families are vital to parts of the countrys social and economic fabric, and we should be building a housing system that creates the conditions for all of us to flourish. So again, we ask that this proposed rule be abandoned to avoid devastating financial burden and untold trauma to the families, especially children and seniors, who would be impacted.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This is a vialacion of rights as resedents of the country.

HAO, collectively, are the largest providers of affordable housing in Oregon and we work together to advocate for policies and resources that create,safe, stable housing options for all Oregonians. This proposed rule change threatens to undermine the overall well-being of low-income Oregonians and their families and further exacerbates child poverty and homelessness.<br/><br/>Oregon is a place that welcomes and embraces immigrants, documented or not, and immigrant communities are a part of the fabric of our state.  According to the most recent estimates, there are 113,000 undocumented immigrants in Oregon. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that well over half of all undocumented immigrants in Oregon have been in the United States for 10 years or more and over three-quarters are over the age of 25 [1] . Many of these Oregonians are long established community members with U.S. born children. We strongly urge you to withdraw this rule as it would cause significant and permanent harm to Oregons children, families and communities.<br/><br/>The proposed rule would result in significant increases in homelessness, particularly unsheltered homelessness.<br/><br/>When families have access to housing assistance, they have more resources to cover the cost of nutritious foods, health care, and other necessities.  Children are able to thrive in school and reach their full potential. Where families live is also directly tied to where they work. If parents lose access to affordable housing, they may also be at risk of losing their jobs and<br/>livelihood.<br/><br/>Our members work within every county in Oregon and bring housing affordability and stability to over 34,000<br/>households through the federal funded Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) and public housing programs. Of these<br/>households, 668 are a part of a mixed family whose assistance is prorated. The vast majority of these Oregonians are<br/>eligible for assistance, and 1,680 are minors.<br/><br/>The proposed rule change puts each and every member of mixed households at risk, even if the majority of household<br/>members are eligible. Families will be forced to make impossible decisions. They can separate, which will create a<br/>devastating impact on their family and their community. It may also mean the loss of a critical care giver or<br/>homemaker, which would create undue financial hardship. If they chose to stay together, it is very likely that they will<br/>face homelessness.<br/><br/>Our children have the most to lose.<br/><br/>Your office is likely aware that Oregon has the highest rate of unsheltered homelessness and one of the highest rates<br/>of homelessness among children with families. We have deep concerns that this proposed rule change will exacerbate<br/>our existing housing crisis, putting children at risk of homelessness.<br/><br/>Many of the mixed households in Oregon include eligible minors. Evicting families from their homes creates a ripple<br/>effect throughout the community. The trauma families face from eviction will follow them. Homeless children cannot<br/>thrive in schools, creating tensions in our classrooms. Any move during middle childhood, particularly for<br/>low-income children, can reduce later earnings, work hours, and educational attainment  without stable housing,<br/>children are not able to focus on their studies and parents are not able to actively<br/>engage in their childrens education [1] .<br/><br/>We also know that with regard to health outcomes, young children who experienced homelessness for longer than six<br/>months were significantly more likely to have developmental delays, fair or poor health, be overweight, and be<br/>hospitalized, than children who never experienced homelessness or did so for less than six months [2] . Children who are<br/>US citizens and who have an undocumented parents or family member have potentially more to lose than just their<br/>homes because of this proposed rule.<br/><br/>The chilling effect of this rule may be greater than the households we have identified. The fear and distrust this rule<br/>brings will have far-reaching effects for the over 200,000 children living with an immigrant parent in Oregon. Even<br/>eligible families may fear accessing housing assistance over concerns about their undocumented loved ones, whether<br/>or not they live in the same household.<br/><br/>On behalf of the Housing Authorities of Oregon, I urge you to reconsider this change and allow mixed status families to<br/>remain in stable, affordable homes.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Joel Madsen<br/>President, Housing Authorities of Oregon</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am opposed to any alteration of this rule which would restrict funds granted for the purpose of housing to anyone residing in the US regardless of citizenship status.

Some families had personal connections to persons who were otherwise considered "undocumented" (some had spouses, some has coworkers, some had children - who do to a timelapse in paperwork went from 'documented' to undocumented).  The reality is that undocumented persons are not the consumer of public housing.  Yes, some live in the housing because their FAMILY is in the housing.  Family ties should not be questioned; families should not be forced apart creating more undue hardships because one person "isn't eligible" for the program.  Time and energy would be better spent helping to enrich these families so they can eventually move out of public housing to better lives and places.  Forcing this upon families currently in your programs will only increase the need for shelters or other assistance. Don't "rob Peter to pay Paul!"<br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development.

This proposed change unjustly punishes mixed status immigrant families that are only exercising their ability to access subsidized housing under current federal law. <br/><br/>The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) mandates that the HUD Secretary shall administer programs "in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of the FHA. In its 2015 regulation, HUD defined affirmatively further fair housing to mean taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. The affirmatively furthering fair housing obligation also includes fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.<br/><br/>In 2010, based on U.S. Census data, the Chicago region had the 5th highest combined racial and economic segregation and the 9th highest Latino-white segregation in the nation. The proposed rule does nothing to advance fair housing aims, help neighborhoods become less segregated, or advance compliance with other civil rights laws. Instead, it seeks to do the exact opposite by denying housing opportunities to thousands of immigrant families, using eligible immigration status as a pretext for discriminating against individuals based on their race and national origin. According to HUDs own analysis, 70 percent of the households negatively impacted by this proposed rule are families with eligible children, and the proposed rule would have a disproportionate and devastating impact on families with children. This clearly discriminatory policy is wholly inconsistent with HUDs obligation to combat housing discrimination and segregation.<br/><br/>This rule will put already-struggling families at further risk of losing their homes, which has the potential to increase need for other social safety networks that are already overburdened as-is. I ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn. Family unity should be considered a fundamental value and component of our immigration system.

This would result in the separation or eviction of mixed status families who live in public and subsidized housing. Families could be evicted after 18 months or sooner.<br/><br/>The rule would also require tens of thousands of housing agencies and private property owners to collect documents proving the citizenship of more than 9 million assisted residents who have already attested that they are US citizens. If individuals are unable to produce the required documents in the designated timeframe, they could lose their housing.<br/><br/>This rule is predicated on Executive Order 13828, Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility. The EO states that our country was founded on principles of freedom and equal opportunity towards self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility. Diminishing children and families access to a roof over their heads, separating families and evicting individuals and families all contradict these principles. <br/><br/>Housing stability for low-income residents is a vital social determinant of health and broader community economic stability. We already know that evictions are a health equity issue - increasing rates of evictions disproportionately impact Black women and their children. In addition, even the threat of eviction leads individuals to report poor health, high blood pressure, depression, anxiety and distress relative to people who experience stable housing. The results of evictions - including overcrowding, homelessness and emergency room visits - also demonstrate various negative health outcomes for adults and children.<br/><br/>Eviction and other forms of housing instability, such as having to move frequently, are particularly harmful for children, which means that these rule changes would harm the health of many children living in mixed-status families. Unstable housing means that children are more likely to have behavioral problems and to struggle in school  and in classrooms where the student population changes quickly and frequently, all students can fall behind. Education itself is linked to positive health outcomes and longer lives: thus, creating housing instability in childrens lives can have immediate and negative health impacts, but can also lead to poorer health across the lifecourse by disrupting their education.<br/><br/>When families have to put too much of their income towards their rent, they cannot afford to pay for other basic needs like food and health care. Hence, problems like food insecurity increase along with housing costs, and many renters delay needed medical care because they cant afford it.<br/><br/>Through its anticipated impact in terms of evictions, this proposal also violates basic just cause principles which have been codified by various cities and states - often as a result of concerted effort by housing justice advocates and partly in response to the fact that evictions have the greatest impact on low-income and Black residents.<br/><br/>Ripping families away from stable housing, or tearing families apart so that only some members can have a home while other do not, have severe and deadly public health outcomes - not just for the families, but for our society. We cannot have healthy, thriving communities by increasing separation and/or displacement and housing instability of low-income children and families. <br/>Thank You<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I do not agree with this proposal because it affects me as a citizen and I have the right to live in dignity. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Secretary Ben Carson,<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule that would prohibit mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing.

This proposed rule change would prohibit mixed-status families from living in public housing and Section 8 programs.  <br/><br/>The proposed rule change would force thousands of families to break up to receive housing assistance, to forego the assistance altogether, or face termination from the programs. In California alone, over 9,000 families would be impacted by this proposed rule change  more than any other state.  The proposal to exclude mixed-status families from affordable housing and Section 8 programs would also be extremely burdensome to implement for housing authorities and private owners of Section-8 assisted properties.  It would force housing providers to focus on terminating and evicting families, diverting resources away from property maintenance and the employment-related services they currently provide.  The additional burden could also deter private housing providers from participating in Section 8 programs, worsening the housing crisis.<br/><br/>In San Diego County, more than one in four community members are immigrants and most families have mixed status. In our region, we already face steep housing costs and limited affordable housing, which has led to a homelessness crisis.  This rule change would force mixed-status families in affordable housing programs to try to find housing in a market that is increasingly less affordable for lower and middle income families, and lead them to choose options that put their loved ones at risk, including substandard housing, vulnerable situations, and/or homelessness.  <br/><br/>Working with the immigrant community in San Diego County, weve heard stories of multiple families in cramming into one-bedroom apartments, families going without water or heat in their homes, and people being forced to live in bug and rodent infested properties that had been neglected by landlords. These families didnt want to live in those places, but they had to because those were the only places they could afford.  In the very worst-case scenario, some of the families who would be impacted by the rule change would end up on the streets, which would exacerbate our regions already dire homelessness situation.<br/><br/>There is an affordable housing crisis in our country, and no region is more aware of that than San Diego.  However, rather than blame immigrant families and exclude mixed-status families from living in public housing and Section 8 programs, the federal administration should make significant new investments in affordable housing resources. Everyone in this country, regardless of their immigration status, should be able to access safe and affordable housing.<br/>The proposed rule change to exclude mixed-status families from public housing and Section 8 programs would prevent thousands of individuals from being able to access this.  <br/><br/>For these reasons, we strongly oppose proposed rule FR-6124-P-01 Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 (Verification of Eligible Status), which would exclude thousands of mixed-status families from public housing and Section 8 programs.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

Mixed-status families pay much higher rents than others, so replacing mixed-status families means increased federal costs to subsidize units - as much as $227m/yr. Then, HUD acknowledges that Congress isnt going to give them money to cover The increased costs of subsidies. HUD says, the likeliest scenario is reducing the quality &amp; quantity of assisted housing in response to higher costs. In other words, HUD says, nobody on waiting list would replace mixed-status families in subsidized housing because thered be fewer households served with vouchers...&amp; reduced money would have impact on public housing &amp; deterioration of units could lead to vacancy. This is confirming that undocumented immigrants dont get housing subsidies and that nobody on the waiting list is helped by this cruel proposal. You want to evict illegal immigrants from subsidized housing, so that legitimate American citizens and Americas most vulnerable are taken care of first. But HUDs own analysis shows that 25,000 mixed-status households with about 108,000 people include 55,000 ELIGIBLE children. In other words, Secretary Carson is proposing to evict 55,000 deeply poor kids that are US citizens or legal residents<br/><br/>Then, you tell us the true motivation behind the proposed rule. <br/><br/>HUD expects the fear of being separated would lead to a prompt evacuation by most mixed-status families, whether or not that fear is justified.<br/><br/>So, does HUD believe that Secretary Carsons proposal will require families to make ruthless choices that may lead to homelessness, with all its associated costs to individuals and society? <br/><br/>Yes, yes it does.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">My father came to this country as an immigrant in 1955 barely speaking english.

We believe the proposed rule will cause survivors and their children to stay in dangerous and life-threatening situations or to lose safe and stable housing, leaving them homeless.  We urge the rule to be withdrawn in its entirety, and that HUDs long-standing regulations remain in effect.<br/><br/>Abusers are well-aware of the link between a survivors financial independence and her access to safety. For immigrant survivors, abusers perpetuate their control by keeping them in a state of isolation, poverty, and economic dependence, conditioning them to fear retaliation not only for trying to flee, but for seeking a work permit and/or employment. They prevent survivors from doing either by holding their immigration documents hostage, leaving them in a state of paralysis.  The proposed rule requires proof of immigration status and submitting such evidence will be challenging for those whose abusers have destroyed or withheld their documents from them as a tool of abuse. Further, even survivors able to work outside the home endure such instability day to day that they face difficulty maintaining regular employment. If a survivor is able to overcome the myriad of challenges and seek federally subsidized housing, under this proposed rule, unless the survivor and her children were all eligible, they would not be able to leave an abusive home, would have to return to one, or become homeless, because the presence of a single ineligible member would lead to disqualification of the entire household.<br/><br/>Survivors of color face individual and institutional discrimination from entities that are intended to provide support or safety, including the police and the criminal justice system, as well as housing providers, from shelter programs to public housing authorities.  In addition to the fear of reporting or seeking support from the systems or institutions purported to help, for survivors in federally subsidized housing impacted by the proposed rule, they would have the additional burden of providing more documentation to be eligible for or to keep safe and stable housing. One survey from 2006 showed that as many as 25 percent of African American citizens lacked a photo ID.  African American survivors without proper documentation would lose stable housing or would not be able to access it, likely ending up homeless. <br/><br/>For the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, nearly 10% of households live in multi-generational homes  a figure that is likely much lower than the actual proportion reported anecdotally from the field, which is closer to 20%. In 2018, over a quarter of a million AAPIs received HUD subsidized housing assistance.   The presence of a single ineligible member of a household could lead to disqualification of the entire household, including survivors who are citizens and their children, and elderly survivors who are eligible for public housing and Section 8 programs. In addition to the impact of this proposed rule on African American and AAPI survivors, there will also be negative consequences for Latino survivors.  <br/><br/>Access to federal housing assistance has allowed hundreds of thousands of Latinos to lift themselves out of poverty. According to analysis conducted by UnidosUS, federal housing assistance  including public and other subsidized housing  lifted approximately 800,000 Latinos out of poverty in 2017, including more than 280,000 Latino children.  While research suggests that Latinos remain underrepresented in these programs,  the proposed rule would deter many eligible survivors from participating in public or subsidized housing programs, and would increase housing insecurity. <br/><br/>For survivors experiencing elder abuse, the fear of coming forward and possibly losing a caregiver, even if the caregiver is also the abuser, and the fear of leaving while simultaneously losing or not being able to qualify for stable housing, would keep elderly survivors in a perpetual state of isolation, fear, and violence. The proposed rule would require that older individuals provide documentary proof of citizenship or nationality, such as a birth certificate, which can be extremely difficult for older individuals. One survey from 2006 showed that 18 percent of citizens over the age 65 do not have a photo ID.  Older individuals face many challenges in getting this kind of documentation, including difficulties getting to government offices to replace lost records, coming up with the funds to replace these records, and some may have never been issued a birth certificate in the first place.   <br/><br/>See Upload for Full Comment Concerns. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Peg Hacskaylo<br/>Founder/CEO<br/>National Alliance for Safe Housing (NASH)</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

It is not an appropriate solution. This administrations approach to immigration has been disastrous and this is more of the same (inhumanely directed). I live in New Mexico and see the affect of the policies being used to address immigration and they are something this nation ought to identify as cruel and without humanitarian concern.<br/>I ask you to refer to the sound arguments made  by our paid and elected officials when similar changes were earlier suggested.

The argument that y'all are making room for US citizens that are waiting for their chance to live in housing is weak. On average, "mixed" families make more money then low-income US families so the government will have to spend much more money to subsidize those US families you claim to be making room for. Meanwhile Washington keeps cutting funding to HUD every few years. This rule is not sustainable, cruel &amp; inhumane. If I hear that this rule gets approved and will go into effect, I will quit on the spot. Good luck to whoever has to break the news to residents that have lived here for many years. From elderly/disabled people to mothers with young children, heartbreak, fear and anger will be rampant at our properties. I'm the only one at this property who knows how to speak spanish so that'll be a stressful period for this property.<br/>The US has lived through increased xenophobia in the past and we will get through this current reiteration we are living through.

The social and societal costs of the likely separations caused if this rule were to be approved are not worth it - will do more damage than good!!! Below are further reasons I oppose it.  <br/>The rationale for this change, to reduce the waiting time for U.S. citizens seeking subsidized housing, is weak. According to the Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation, approximately 1.6 million families are looking for subsidized housing. Freeing up about 25,000 units will do little to reduce HUD waiting lists.<br/>According to HUD data, over half of the persons living in mixed-status families are U.S. citizen children under the age of 17. These children are at risk of losing their homes.<br/>Not all ineligible household members are undocumented. They could be ineligible for subsidized housing for other reasons.<br/>This rule change would put additional strains on local housing authorities. Removing a family is not cost-free. It entails administrative staff time and legal resources. These local housing authorities are already overburdened.<br/>Fear of family separation could prompt mixed-status families to vacate pubic or subsidized housing whether or not the fear is justified.<br/>If the Trump administration was serious about addressing the housing crisis in the U.S. today, they would not have slashed funding for affordable housing in their FY 2020 HUD budget request.<br/>This rule change seems to be rooted in the strong anti-immigrant stance that is a hallmark of this administration rather than in a genuine concern for the housing needs of low-income individuals and families.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>I write as the associate pastor of a Catholic parish in East Los Angeles which directly serves a predominantly immigrant community in two large public housing projects. Our community would be decimated by this proposed rule change. This is no exaggeration or hyperbole; it is a bare fact. So-called 'mixed families' make up 70% of our school community and to displace 'unqualified family members' is a direct disruption to not only the entire family, but to the entire social and cultural fabric of our neighborhood. <br/><br/>This rule change appears to be motivated by little more than hateful political tactics set on terrorizing low-income communities of color. HUDs own research indicates that this would be a substantial loss of rental income, leading, I fear, to future eviction of more families and/or further privatization of public housing units. It is a cruel and heartless proposal which does nothing to solve a national housing crisis nor an international moral crises of character. We long for a society of inclusion and belonging. Further displacement of families most in need is a huge step in the wrong direction. I can't oppose this kind of decision-making strongly enough. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">As someone who works with the Sisters of Mercy, who take a vow of service to people who are poor, I am very concerned about this proposed rule that could leave many families, including thousands of children, without access to housing. <br/><br/>The current regulation, which allows mixed-status families to live in public or other subsidized housing as long as the undocumented relative(s) does/do not receive direct subsidies, seems fair and just. <br/><br/>I appreciate that the Trump Administration has expressed concern that US-citizen families are on long waiting lists to access subsidized housing. But if the administration was serious about addressing the housing crisis in the US today, you would not have slashed affordable housing funding in the FY2020 HUD budget request. <br/><br/>The proper response to the housing crunch is additional affordable housing and more subsidies to cover the costs for our most poor and vulnerable neighbors.

Mixed-status families (consisting of an ineligible immigrant and eligible immigrants and/or U.S. citizens)receive a prorated subsidy that is based on the number of eligible members of the household. By HUDs own analysis, the removal of prorated subsidies would cost HUD an estimated additional $193 to $227 million annually in order to serve the same number of individuals. This means that HUD would need Congress  to  either  significantly  increase  funding  to  the  public  housing  and HCV programs  or  serve significantly fewer households.This  proposed  change  forces  families  to  choose  between  separating  or  being  evicted  and  becoming vulnerable to homelessness. It will bring financial hardship onto more  families, and potentially weaken the  familial  and  social  networks  that  can help  defend against  homelessness.  Additionally,  children of ineligible immigrants (many of whom are U.S.-born)may end up in the care of other family members or friends  and,  quite  possibly,  even  foster  care.Thousands  of  children  may  end  up  losing  either  family members or stable housing.<br/><br/>This measure would force more families into homelessness at a time when we need to be providing for the needs of the most vulnerable, rather than prioritizing the pocketbooks of the well-off. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to ask you to please stop the cruelty.

I strongly oppose this rule and request that this rule be withdrawn in its entirety. <br/><br/>I've worked in public health for almost fifteen years.  I've lived in developing and other developed countries.  Through my experience, both lived and professional, I've learned that above all, we are all human beings.  We must prioritize treating each other with dignity, respect, and with care to ensure basic human rights - including a safe place to live.<br/><br/>This rule is a transparent effort to attack immigrant families. While there is a shared concern regarding the ongoing crisis of affordable housing, immigrant families are not the source of the problem. Analysis conducted by HUD finds  that fewer, not more, families are likely to receive assistance as a result of the rule. The real issue is the lack of sufficient funding to ensure that every family, regardless of immigration status, has access to one of the most basic of rightsa safe place to call home. If the administration or HUD truly wanted to address the crisis of affordable housing, they would work with congress to fund HUD and implement new programs to support access to affordable and safe housing. <br/><br/>The impact of this proposed rule may be particularly harmful for children. It will create an impossibly difficult decision for mixed-status families: remain together as a family without housing support, or separate so some members may receive assistance. This is a decision no family should have to make and that certainly the government shouldnt force families to make. The fact that HUD itself recognizes that mixed-status families will likely choose to remain together stating in their analysis that HUD expects that fear of the family being separated would lead to prompt evacuation by most mixed households, whether that fear is justified. Using fear as a policy tool is immoral and despicable. <br/><br/>This rule wont just harm mixed-status citizen and immigrant families, the proposed rule creates requirements that threatens housing security for 9.5 million U.S. citizens currently receiving HUD assistance and all future U.S. citizens seeking these benefits.  The rule would require that all who declare they are U.S. citizens under penalty of perjury provide evidence of their citizenship, a practice that has proven to be burdensome, costly and unnecessary to protect program integrity. This restriction was implemented in other health and social service programs and led to a decline in enrollment in services among eligible individuals. Obtaining documentation of citizenship can be costly. It can be difficult for low-income, elderly, people living in rural areas or with limited transportation. <br/><br/>People who are evicted from their homes (or threatened with eviction) are more likely to experience health issues like depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure than people with stable housing. They are also more likely to experience long-term housing instability, and visit an emergency room.  Eviction and other forms of instability, are particularly harmful for children. Unstable housing can mean that kids are more likely to have behavioral problems and to struggle in school . Education itself is linked to positive health outcomes and longer lives; thus, creating housing instability in childrens lives can have immediate and negative health impacts, but can also lead to poorer health across the life course by disrupting their education. <br/><br/>This rule change would leave families with the terrible choice of either losing their housing or splitting up their family members. Rather than continuing to target and scapegoat immigrant families, we should support public health and strengthen our communities by working to expand housing subsidies and supports for all low-income families. <br/>I urge you to reject this proposed rule. <br/><br/>Clarissa Phillips, MPH<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am strongly opposed to this rule change, as it is unnecessary, cruel, and ultimately would have negative economic impact on New York and the federal government.

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>I'd like to break this proposed rule down a bit. If a family is housed and one member is not a citizen this proposed new rule will evict the entire family thus making the entire family homeless and making it even more difficult to re-house them. Affordable housing is not an easy thing to find and I'll get to that in a minute.<br/><br/>Here's some facts about these families this rule would effect:<br/>"In an analysis of its proposed rule change, HUD said that mixed-family households typically contain three members who are eligible for the housing assistance and one who is not."<br/><br/>So because one person in this family of 4 is not eligible, 4 people become homeless. Or is this family of 4 supposed to kick out the mother or the father or whatever other family member they happen to be? That one person deserves to be homeless and not live with the family they were housed with because of the invisible boarder they were born across? No one deserves to be homeless. Having a roof over your head is a basic human right. End of story. You won't convince me otherwise.<br/><br/>"If the rule goes into effect, undocumented immigrants living in public housing would not be immediately removed, the official said. They would be given up to 18 months, through three six-month waivers, to relocate."<br/><br/>Ok so they're going to give families time to relocate and not immediately kick them out. Sounds great to you right? I'm sure a middle class white American would have no issue finding something they can afford to rent in 18 months. But that is not the population who we're dealing with. We're dealing with immigrants, people of color, marginalized individuals that this proposed rule would marginalize even more. You know the entire United States is in an affordable housing crisis right? And if these families are enrolled in voucher programs living in units that accept those vouchers, there's already an existing reason for it in their lives that isn't going to magically go away especially because now their vouchers are going to be taken away because of the ineligibility of one of their family members and they'll be pushed out into the fair market competing with people like you and me who have no issues holding down a job or even getting a job and can afford child care and don't have to live in a one bedroom apartment with your entire family because its all you can afford now.<br/><br/>"Around 25,000 families of mixed-immigration status are currently receiving housing assistance, mainly in Texas, California and New York, HUD said in its analysis. Those households represent about 108,104 individuals, around 70% of whom are legally eligible for benefits. About 56,030 of those are children."<br/><br/>25,000 families being evicted equals out to about 108,104 individuals. 70% or about 75,673 of which are legally eligible for that housing. Of those that are LEGALLY ELIGIBLE, 56,030 or 74% are CHILDREN. 74% of the people that could become homeless under this proposed rule, despite being legally eligible for the house they are already living in, are children. <br/><br/>And out of the total individuals that could BECOME homeless regardless of eligibility status, 52% are CHILDREN. So because of about 32,431 people who are ineligible but are living with people who are eligible, you're going to make 108,104 total people homeless and put a strain on all the other resources outside of housing in those communities without those resources getting an increase in support from HUD. It costs communities less and puts less strain on existing resources to keep people housed. Extensive research has been done about this by HUD, so you should already be well aware of all these facts and data and know that the math doesn't even make sense to implement this new rule. Listen to the data.<br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

Often times all or some children are US citizens. Public housing programs allow for these families to continue living together, while the undocumented family members work on their citizenship status.  Excluding mixed families from public housing will not only add to the homeless population, it will cause physical health and mental health problems, deter the children from being able to attend school, and make it so that the parents are unable to save any amount of money to aid in lifting themselves out of poverty. <br/><br/>Additionally, it is unethical to not allow families to participate in public housing knowing that the alternative is unsafe housing or homelessness.

The effects would be largely the same, and it would cost far less.<br/><br/>According to HUD's impact analysis, some 108,000 people, including 55,000 children, would be affected by this screening process -- which HUD itself estimates will cost millions to implement, and will incur annual extra costs to HUD of $200 million.<br/><br/>This approach is roughly parallel to the federal government's current brutal campaign against prospective asylum seekers, immigrants and refugees at the southwest border. Just like that campaign, the currently proposed screening process will surely incur massive legal costs, when it is met inevitably with aggressive court fights to prevent its implementation. Such legal actions would surely underscore the predictable impact on the surrounding communities: surging homelessness and massive social disruption -- tantamount to war in the streets of New York City. There would be significant cost overruns to the police budget, and enormous economic damages from disrupted businesses across the city.<br/><br/>HUD leadership may believe this approach is somehow legal, despite the obvious violations of Article IV and VIII of the U.S. Constitution/Bill of Rights, and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which the USA is a signatory and thus bound to abide by its letter and principles.

Families that stay together stand to benefit from each other's support to overcome adversity. Immigrant families deserve to stay as one family, regardless of their legal status and or where in their process of legalization they may be. I truly believe that as a society we stand to gain by our unity and concern for the prosperity of all.

Currently, these families can live together, with the housing subsidy decreased such that members who are not eligible for assistance do not receive it.<br/><br/>The new rule would force mixed-status families to break up so that eligible members can receive housing assistance, or forego the assistance altogether.  HUDs own analysis shows that more than 55,000 children, who are U.S. citizens or otherwise eligible for housing benefits, could face eviction under this new rule.  Thousands of immigrant families will lose access to affordable housing and face homelessness.  This is devastating for the people who become homeless, and for their communities as emergency housing and assistance programs become overwhelmed.  Everyone benefits when individuals and families can stay in safe, affordable housing.  To address the affordable housing crisis effectively, the administration should instead support sufficient funding of housing assistance.<br/><br/>In Winston-Salem, NC, I have the privilege of working, learning, and worshipping with many immigrants who would be affected by changes in the proposed rule change.  My church has strong relationships with immigrant fellowships, and I am a volunteer coach for a youth development program at a Latinx community center.  Many of these families -- like many American citizens -- rely on housing programs to provide their children with the best chance to learn and thrive.  The proposed HUD rule will cause further fear among immigrants and their families, and cause many to forego housing assistance and face homelessness. <br/><br/>As immigration policies and enforcement have become less welcoming to immigrants over the past two years, I have grieved the impact on our entire community.  Many immigrants have curtailed their participation in community and volunteer efforts because they are afraid to drive or appear in public, and because their lives have simply become more difficult as they struggle to secure a livelihood and basic needs.  Finalizing a rule like the proposed HUD rule prohibiting mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing will only create more fear and send a message to our immigrant neighbors that they are not welcome.  These are hard-working people who have fled great hardship, and have gifts and skills to contribute to our communities.  I would like to see our resources directed toward assisting them to access housing, good nutrition, health care, education, and other basic services that will help them move out of poverty.<br/><br/>I urge HUD to withdraw this proposal and continue allowing immigrants to receive the assistance they need to remain housed  ready to learn, work, and contribute their limitless potential to our nation.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Megan M.

The changes proposed are specifically designed to force families to make choices that will harm their childs health. Mixed status families will have to make the excruciating decision to either face eviction or separate as a family in order to retain housing stability. Both options will have lasting impacts on child and family health. Research shows that families who are evicted are more likely to experience homelessness, move into substandard or overcrowded housing, and have a sequence of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. The alternative, family separation, is a stressful and traumatizing experience for children, which can alter the architecture of a childs developing brain and have lifelong consequences.<br/><br/>In Illinois, 60% of people receiving federal rental assistance are in families with children. Rental assistance helps 263,000 people in families with children in Illinois avoid homelessness.<br/><br/>Housing assistance also improves child healthchildren of families receiving housing assistance had a 35 percent higher chance of being labeled a well child, a 28 percent lower risk of being seriously underweight and a 19 percent lower risk of food insecurity. Access to affordable housing provides stability for families and frees up income for other necessities. Low-income households with children that pay more than half of their monthly income on rent spend considerably less on other basic necessitiesthey spend $200 less per month on food, nearly $100 less on transportation, and about $80 less on healthcare.I strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule to prohibit mixed status families from living in subsidized housing. This proposed change unjustly punishes mixed status immigrant families that are only exercising their ability access subsidized housing under current federal law. <br/><br/>We, at the Moran Center for Youth Advocacy in Evanston, ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn.

I cannot overstate how devastating this would be to the work I do.  HUD cites the desperate shortage of housing resources as justification for this rule.  I am aware of the subsidy and affordable housing shortage.  I see the devastating humanitarian tragedies it causes every day in my work- but putting more strings and restrictions on the little resources we do have, while uprooting the lives of tens of thousands of people and pushing more people into homelessness is not the way to make our resources go further.  This will create a new and larger crisis - which is saying something because the status quo for affordable housing is quite terrible as it is.<br/><br/>Mixed status families exist and are valuable.  This policy will force families to split up or stay on the street.  Their unnecesary displacement will require use of limited shelter space and scarce homelessness resources.  This will not magically open up housing slots for US citizens, it will make it harder for everyone to access housing resources.  This is bad for my resource strapped community, traumatizing for tens of thousands of children, and inhumane.  <br/><br/>Even in the long run, I can only see this policy making it harder for my unhoused neighbors to access resources.  Proving legal status for every family member is difficult - homeless households have often lost all their documentation and a lost green card can take months or years to replace.  Another year on the street means more resources going to ER visits, less economic contribution from the members of the family who work, lost time in school for children, and more trauma for the community - undocumented and documented alike.<br/><br/>We have a shortage of resources. This proposed change would make it harder to use those scarce resources efficiently, and cause unnecesary and terrible harm to families and communities.

Because housing is an undeniable human need and a determinant of health, we believe the proposed rule, if adopted, will cause harm to many of the populations we serve.  <br/><br/>For example:<br/> The proposed rule threatens the health of children, and will effectively evict over 55,000 children who are eligible for the covered housing programs. Children of families that receive housing assistance have a 35 percent higher chance of being labeled a medically well child, a 28 percent lower risk of being seriously underweight, and a 19 percent lower risk of food insecurity. <br/> Certain immigrant survivors of gender-based violence such as human trafficking, sexual assault, and domestic violence will be severely and disproportionately harmed by HUDs proposed rule. If the proposed rule goes into effect, ineligible survivors and their eligible children who are trying to escape violent homes will be trapped in a false choicehomelessness or remaining with an abuser. Those already living in subsidized housing who are evicted and forced to return to a violent home will face an even greater risk to their safety.<br/> Nearly one-third of LGBTQ immigrants are undocumented, indicating that a significant number of LGBTQ bi-national couples could be impacted by this proposed rule. As a result of systemic discrimination, LGBTQ people are 2.5 times more likely to receive public housing assistance than their non-LGBTQ peers. The need for these programs is especially acute for transgender people, LGBTQ people with disabilities, and LGBTQ people of color.<br/><br/>In short, the proposed rule will force many families to choose between being torn apart or facing homelessness, causing potentially devastating emotional and physical health impact. <br/><br/>We ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn, and that family unity and a healthy environment be considered fundamental values and components of our immigration system.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety.  This rule represents a cruel intersection between ongoing persecution of immigrants and financial and political trends that have devastated the supply of affordable housing. For many people, housing consumes an unsustainably high proportion of their income, because not only has the supply of low-income housing not kept pace, but there has been little new construction and an accelerated pace of destruction of public housing. <br/><br/>Contrary to the scare stories about immigrants, the vast majority of immigrants are honest, hard-working people--but many of them are poor. They are especially likely to require housing assistance so that they can continue to hold jobs and raise families--including US citizen children. Without this assistance, the children are at high risk of having to move to inferior, substandard housing--or, indeed, becoming homeless.<br/><br/>The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Dana Shilling<br/>41 Mercer St  Jersey City, NJ 07302-3515</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Hello I am a us citizen born here in america while my parents were born in latin america HOWEVER my parents registered to apply to enter the US they did paid all the fees to the government they did all the health screenings asked of them they allowed all the background screening .

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>Housing is a very important structure for the nation and withholding such services for the people living in the United States, regardless of citizenship, should not be done. You forced hundreds and hundred of families who are trying to make a living and without this support you have endless amount of homelessness in the U.S., which we are all working on trying to prevent. I oppose of this rule as this will only harm U.S. and non U.S. citizens alike. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Secretary Carson:<br/>As an elected leader in the City of San Diego I strongly oppose the proposed rule published in the Federal Register (Docket No. FR-6124-P-01) regarding the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980: Verification of Eligible Status and retain the current U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations regarding household eligibility to receive housing assistance. The proposed changes put our children in danger and affect the quality of life of one of our most vulnerable populations in our Binational region. <br/>In the City of San Diego, the eighth largest city in the nation, the San Diego Housing Commission provides federal rental assistance to more than 15,000 low-income households. Of these households, 325 currently receive prorated assistance because they are mixed households. HUD's proposed rule, if implemented, would adversely affect vulnerable families with children in low-income households by potentially ending the housing assistance they currently receive, which potentially puts them at risk of homelessness. <br/>Approximately 18 million children in the U.S. live in a family with at least one immigrant parent,  and an estimated 5 million children (of whom more than 80 percent are U.S. citizens) live in homes with at least one undocumented parent.   While the majority of children in these households are citizens, the fact that they have at least one member of their household who has limited or no eligibility for public assistance based on their immigration status means that children in immigrant families have higher rates of poverty than children in U.S.-born families.  <br/>We need policies that expand, not reduce, access to stable homes for families with children in order to ensure all children have opportunities to be healthy and reach their highest potential. Furthermore, if the proposed rule goes into effect, ineligible survivors and their eligible children who are trying to escape violent homes will be trapped in a false choicehomelessness or remaining with an abuser. Those already living in subsidized housing who are evicted and forced to return to a violent home will face an even greater risk to their safety. It is commonly known that the danger to a victim actually increases once she/he escapes, with one estimate noting a 75% increase in violence for at least two years following an escape. <br/>Undocumented survivors suffer in silence, deterred from seeking recourse by the looming threat of immigration, incarceration, or deportation. Overcrowding at shelters, or rules prohibiting children with disabilities from residing there, drive many back onto the streets.  Others face discrimination such that either no one will rent to them, or they cannot have their name on a lease or utility bills.<br/>For these reasons, I strongly urge you to withdraw the proposed rule. Please feel free to contact Lara Gates, Chief of Policy, at (619) 236-7754 if you need any further information regarding this letter.<br/><br/>Please find the complete letter attached. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Council President Georgette Gmez<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule to prohibit mixed status families from living in subsidized housing.

Many live in mixed households and rely on low income housing to avoid homelessness due to the low wages they receive picking the harvest. I work with these families daily and see first hand the devastating effect this new proposed rule will have on these mixed immigrant household families. <br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development. Experiencing the stress of housing instability is harmful to young childrens development. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw its current proposal.

Economic: regardless of status, immigrants pay taxes into the system that funds HUD and this change will make things more expensive. <br/>2. Legal: the current law already prohibits undocumented people from accessing subsidies, and it will prevent people from engaging in the legal system and reporting crime. By HUDs own analysis, more than 55,000 children, who are U.S. citizens or who are otherwise legally eligible to receive housing benefits, could face eviction under the proposed rule. <br/>3. Moral: these are our neighbors, classmates of our children, and people who were just like us - one or two or ten generations back.<br/><br/>As a public health professional and the director of a community organization, I know that this change will only result in children being separated from their caretakers, community instability, and worsened family health. There will be increased community violence as victims of domestic, gender, or child violence would be fearful to report abuse at the risk of losing their housing. <br/><br/>This proposal is cruel and is against the moral arc of our country.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing.

Second, because the role of local law enforcement is unclear, we fear that it will produce an additional chilling effect on our Task Force members' ability to provide local government services, such as property inspections, if residents or the landlord feels at risk of a federal immigration action.

As it stands now ineligible citizens are not receiving federal housing subsidies, assistance is pro-rated for the eligible members of the household. Don't take away benefits to people that are lawfully eligible to receive them and that is exactly what this rule is proposing to do. The rule states its intent is to better align with the purpose of Section 214, but that is exactly what is occurring now. Housing Authorities are already required to verify citizenship status through the Department of Homeland Securities SAVE system and then pro-rate assistance only for lawfully present members of the household. By changing the language to now exclude full households even if they contain lawful citizens HUD would be effectively discriminating against US Citizens eligible for the benefit and denying them inappropriately.

In addition, this proposed rule doesn't make financial sense. Again according to HUD's own analysis, the agency would actually lose money due to the costs of enforcing the rule as well as the increased subsidies the agency estimates it would have to pay (mixed-immigration-status families have a higher average income).

We need to use this as a guide for other organizations to VERIFY that ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS are not receiving benefits that are for LEGAL citizens.  I would also propose that a verification of being drug free be added also to ensure we are not providing housing benefits for people using drugs illegally.  The drug testing would be paid by the recipient for the first test and the government would reimburse the recipients thereafter as long as they PASS the drug test.  Failure of the drug test would disallow all benefits for a minimum of 90 days with a negative drug test result.  This would ensure that the government is not funding peoples drug addictions by providing public housing.

The change would impact only about 25,000 mixed immigration status families. Even if they were all evicted, this would only free up 25,000 units, a tiny fraction of the 1.6 million units that the Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation reports are needed.<br/><br/>This rule change would also negatively impact thousands of U.S. citizen children who live in mixed status families. HUD estimates that about half of the persons living in mixed status families are children under the age of 17.  These U.S. citizen children risk becoming homeless.<br/><br/>A more constructive remedy for the problem of long waiting lists for affordable housing would be greater funding for HUD programs.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. This is an unjust rule that ignores basic human decency - families should not be split up, and if one person in the family has not obtained legal citizenship punishing the other members - most likely children and women - is cruel and produces nothing but chaos and distress.  I do not want to live in a land of detention camps and people on the streets, and what you are doing in your position at Housing and Urban Development will create that. This is against the mandate for your department and does damage to all Americans.<br/><br/>Your rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing.

I have seen many families come and go through our facilities that are in need or were in need of housing. Seeing these families sleep in their cars with their small children is heartbreaking. It is inhumane to leave these poor children in the cold while we have a place to sleep. It is unethical to do nothing about the level of homelessness we are facing today in the United States. We need to keep our families together, so children can grow and be progressive members of society. <br/><br/>Many mixed families have been in the United States for years and work everyday to keep food on the table for their children. These families work everyday to achieve the American dream they came here for. Putting these families on the streets will not solve the problem, on the contrary, it will make the problem bigger. There will be more requests for aid because they will not be working. There will be more need for shelters, food and centers that will be able to accept the families that will be out in the cold. Clients are dying in the cold every night because they have no place to sleep. The level of homeless is rising and there are not enough resources and funding to help with the wave of need that will come our way if we allow these families to become homeless. <br/><br/>All of the mixed families in low income housing have a different story as to why they are in low income housing and how they got here. We need to help them progress in society, so their children can succeed in school in a healthy way, instead of throwing them out in the streets. These families are hardworking families whom deserve to be here , while working hard everyday. Specially in California, has the rent gone up so much, and is becoming harder and harder to find affordable housing for anyone. There are long waiting lists for all the affordable housing in the surrounding areas that families don't know where to turn anymore. <br/><br/>We need to find a different solution to the problem. We need to find more funding for these affordable housing units and expand, so more families have the opportunity to live a healthy and safe life in a home. Blaming these families is very heartbreaking, because it is not their fault this crisis is happening in the United States. Please, think about the poor children that sleep in cars every night, when we are supposed to be the BEST and most WELCOMING country there is in the world. Please think about the many more problems you will cause if these families are put out of their affordable housing. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

New Destiny opposes the verification of eligible status rule due to the likelihood of an increase in homeless families who will be evicted from affordable housing. In addition, the rule requires affordable housing organizations to collect and verify documentation of citizenship  adding to the already significantly large reporting burdens due to requirements of other federal program such as HOME and LIHTC, as well as the burden that the rule places on affordable housing providers such as New Destiny. We urge the rule to be withdrawn in its entirety, and that HUDs long-standing regulations remain in effect.<br/><br/>New Destinys mission is to end the cycle of violence for low-income families and individuals at risk of homelessness and domestic violence by connecting them to safe, permanent housing and services. We build and manage housing with on-site services in New York City and offer innovative programs that empower victims of abuse to find and retain affordable housing; and expand access to permanent housing resources for low-income families. <br/><br/>Instances of how this rule change will impact include for instance, a mixed-status family (and we currently have several) living in a LIHTC unit that has Section 8 would be affected. This would reduce our ability to serve families where the head of household might be ineligible (broader definition than undocumented) but the children are U.S. citizens. In addition, New York City families impacted by the proposed rule would be eligible for a temporary deferral of termination of assistance because of New York Citys extremely low vacancy rate.  However, the deferral is only temporary.<br/><br/>We urge HUD to immediately withdraw its current proposal, and dedicate its efforts to advancing policies that strengthenrather than underminethe ability of immigrants to support themselves and their families in the future. If we want our communities to thrive, everyone in those communities must be able to stay together and get the care, services and support they need to remain healthy and productive.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">As a veteran who has served this great nation I give full support to implementing this rule.

These impacts in turn ripple out into society creating greater burdens on under-funded social services, hospitals, and facilities struggling to support people experiencing eviction/homelessness.  <br/><br/>Under current policy, HUD already prorates rental assistance to cover only eligible family members.  In other words, as is, with no rule change, HUD funding is not going to people lacking documentation.  There is no fiscal argument favoring this change.  All this does de facto is break-up low-income families and deprive marginalized people of basic human shelter needs.<br/><br/>Do the smart thing, drop this rule change.  </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am opposed to this change.

Just looking at this from the perspective of people with disabilities, do you know what the monthly payment is for someone on SSI?  $771/month.  Who can find housing with that?  Immigrants share living spaces anyway because they often work minimum wage jobs (or two or three) sharing housing is the only way some of them can have roofs over their heads.  What is being proposed will be leaving a person with a disability, who needs the support of their family members, alone and at great loss of companionship and support. This  will force some people into nursing homes or other institutions.  Community living is ever so much cheaper, healthier, and sociable than institutional living but the choice will be gone when families are separated. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

Families have the right to housing which is safe and provides the environment for raising and educating children.  The change being considered seems to "throw the family out with the bath water."<br/>1.  The rationale for this change, to reduce the waiting time for U.S. citizens seeking subsidized housing, is weak. According to the Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation, approximately 1.6 million families are looking for subsidized housing. Freeing up about 25,000 units will do little to reduce HUD waiting lists.<br/>2. According to HUD data, over half of the persons living in mixed-status families are U.S. citizen children under the age of 17. These children are at risk of losing their homes.<br/>3. Not all ineligible household members are undocumented. They could be ineligible for subsidized housing for other reasons.<br/>4. This rule change would put additional strains on local housing authorities. Removing a family is not cost-free. It entails administrative staff time and legal resources. These local housing authorities are already overburdened.<br/>5. Fear of family separation could prompt mixed-status families to vacate pubic or subsidized housing whether or not the fear is justified.<br/>6. If the Trump administration was serious about addressing the housing crisis in the U.S. today, they would not have slashed funding for affordable housing in their FY 2020 HUD budget request.<br/>7. This rule change seems to be rooted in the strong anti-immigrant stance that is a hallmark of this administration rather than in a genuine concern for the housing needs of low-income individuals and families.<br/>Thank you for voting against this change.<br/>dave</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This is seriously messed up.

My name is Milagro Jones. I am a formerly homeless single parent living in Los Angeles, California. First I would like to thank everyone at H.U.D. for the hard work they do. I have had the opportunity and privilege of serving in the AmeriCorps program Public Allies as a Community Outreach Coordinator for the Community Development Grants Administration Office of the City of Milwaukee, the lead agency of the Milwaukee Continuum of Care from 2015 to 2016. I served from 2016 to 2018 in the National Youth Forum on Homelessness. I worked alongside national partners in the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, True Colors United, and A Way Home America. Through the portability program I was able to flee domestic violence and keep my daughter safe from habitual child abuse. I will forever be grateful for the Section 8 voucher program and the opportunities it has given me and my daughter. All of this being said I can only imagine the heartbreak and trauma if my daughter and I were separated because our citizenship status made us ineligible to keep our housing. <br/>Dr. Ben Carson quoted scripture from the Bible when he testified in Congress about the inspiration for his Envision Centers. I wonder if he is familiar with the verse, Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the son of man has no place to lay his head. Im not an expert in theology but I believe that verse implies that Jesus Christ himself experienced homelessness while living here on earth. You dont need to believe in the supernatural to know that this proposed rule would tear apart families and cause irreparable damage to the lives of young Americans. I am very privileged to be an American citizen. I am very privileged to be a current voucher holder at a time when the housing crisis in America is causing families and individuals to become homeless every day. I serve in my Neighborhood Council and pursue my education at Los Angeles Trade Technical and Community College because I love people and I want to serve America. I write this comment today to beg you to reconsider your rule proposal and the ramifications it will have on future generations. Is it wise to tear apart families? Is it just and equitable to propose rules that will make life harder for a vulnerable population that has already survived so much hardship to pursue the American Dream?<br/>Everyday when I rise from my slumber I awaken to a world where America shines as a beacon of hope and a ray of freedom. I can humbly struggle through any adversity because I know that I am blessed to live in a nation that offers opportunities unlike anywhere else on earth to the people of this planet. Some of the greatest minds and bodies have emigrated here to America to offer their talents and strength in the task of building a truly great society. I am honored to live in a city that serves as a sanctuary for immigrants that have defied the odds to pursue happiness in a modern metropolis. If theres anything close to utopia and paradise here on earth I can say with sincerity that I am in it. It is only when we forget our rich American history and tradition  of immigration that we begin to transform our paradise into a dark foreboding fortress where we need walls to keep out families and children we call enemies.<br/>It was a dream of mine to meet the people who work at H.U.D. I browsed their regulations the way fangirls browse KPop sites. I read books and scoured articles that had small mention of H.U.D. I learned of the accusations of mismanagement and greed hurled at past directors. I imagined the rotating door of government appointees and wondered who was clocking in and out all those years that I had spent growing in poverty and homelessness. I wondered if my life could have been changed if their had been different policies enacted in the decades before I was born. I was mystified by the power these imagined figures held over the lives of us poor folks whose dreams seemed to fade in a thick fog. I created opportunity when there was none and after many years of dreaming I reached H.U.D. <br/>I shook hands and hugged employees in Washington DC. I attended conferences on ending homelessness and worked on reviewing grants. I slept in Hotels where homeless encampments lay nearby in the shadows. I live with survivors guilt everyday and I must advocate for the men, women, and children that this rule proposal will cast out into the streets. I am one of the success stories of the American attempt at providing a safety net. I havent reached my full potential but I am housed, fed, and educated only because of the privilege that my citizenship status grants me. Congress needs to enact an immigration policy that protects law abiding hard working men and women that come here to the land of opportunity with a dream. Until that day I beg you not to propose or pass this rule or any other rules like it</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

HUD argues that the proposed rule is necessary to address long wait lists for housing assistance, while HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits. We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis but blaming struggling immigrant families has not proven successful in remedying the situation and will hurt legal, law-abiding citizens, that would otherwise, greatly enrich our nation. <br/><br/>This rule could affect people like Gloria. Shes one of Mercy Housings most exemplary employees, and had this law been in place during her youth, Gloria and her family would have lost their housing and her ability to maintain or find employment, while homeless, would have been nearly impossible. As a legal, tax-paying citizen Glorias job helps her fellow U.S. citizen, that was formerly homeless, get on their feet, apply for jobs, move onto brighter futures, and be successful members of the community. The damage to families, and individuals like Gloria, resulting from this rule borders on criminal.  <br/><br/>I recommend that HUD look to Mercy Housings founding principal, we can do better, and rethink this proposal to uproot Americas youth with costly and unproductive measures. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to the building block of a nations success  stable homes, where people can pursue brighter futures. HUDs own language cites that this rule is meant as a fear-producing tactic: HUD expects that fear of the family being separated would lead to prompt evacuation by most mixed households, whether that fear is justified. Using fear to break up families is an egregious method that ignores the founding principles of this country. Furthermore, the purpose of this rule is to allocate resources to taxpayers more efficiently, yet HUDs own estimates foresee that the rule would cost another $193 million to $227 million a year.<br/><br/>What has happened to the moral compass of this country? HUD states its mission as creating strong, sustainable, inclusive communities in quality affordable homes for all. This proposed mixed status rule is a travesty. I urge the Trump Administration to immediately withdraw this proposed rule as it is clearly counter to the mission of HUD, hurts taxpayers, burdens families, and degrades us as Americans. <br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>I am from Boise, Idaho, a welcoming city and home to a large refugee population. It is also in the middle of an agricultural region that is home to a significant number of migrant workers and their families. They are not just numbers or statistics or a faceless population to be feared to denigrated. They are our neighbors, friends, co-workers, our children's playmates, and valued members of society. <br/><br/>As it stands, my community cannot support its residents with affordable housing, regardless of their immigration status. The average home price currently hovers around $350k, and vacancy is around 2%. If the individuals and families currently living in HUD-assisted housing are evicted, this will only serve to increase the burden felt here in Idaho and across the entire country as people are displaced without other viable options for housing. Housing assistance waitlists in the Boise are upwards of one to two years. This is standard across the region of southern Idaho and eastern Washington. Evicting mixed-status families will not reduce the wait list for US citizens, rather it will cost even more in the long run ($200 million more to cover all eligible individuals) and increase the potential for homelessness among families who are currently housed. Alternative solutions to the national housing crisis must be sought, but not at the expense of breaking up family units, displacing the vulnerable (50,000 children and 120,000 elderly adults) and further driving up the administrative costs to provide assistance. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Please dont pass this rule is inhuman an cruel for kids that live in mixed families.<br/>Those kids are citizens and they need a home to live </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I oppose this rule change that would prohibit families of mixed immigrant status from living in federal affordable housing program units. In order to stay together families will be forced to move out of affordable housing at a time of rapidly escalating housing costs, and would increase the likelihood of the family becoming homeless. The rule change will also force the difficult decision of family separation, such as an undocumented father having to leave his family in order to find housing elsewhere, a cruel situation, or a child having to be placed with non family members if his or her parents are both ineligible but the child is a citizen.  <br/><br/>By HUD's own analysis, this rule will result in an increase annual burden to to HUD of $193 - $227 million and will increase costs to taxpayers.  This rule has the potential to displace tens of thousands of people, many of whom are U.S. citizens and children. The HUD analysis states that 70% of total mixed families have eligible children and ineligible parents.  The HUD analysis also states that "temporary homelessness could arise for a household, if they are unable to find alternative housing, for example in tight housing markets."  One has to assume that if the family could afford non-subsidized housing, they would not have applied for or have been eligible to receive vouchers in the first place.  Homelessness is very rarely temporary; it causes jobs to be lost, prohibits children from attending school, impacts physical and mental health and, over time, can lead to substance abuse and criminal activity just to survive.  The costs to society when these things happen are huge.<br/><br/>This rule change will cost taxpayers more and will create huge disruption to our communities as an estimated 80,000 people are displaced from their homes, potentially adding to the already devastating numbers of homeless people in our country.  I urge you to leave the rule as it is or look for alternate solutions that will not add to our deepening homelessness crises and does not penalized hard working immigrant families whose tax dollars contribute to the greater good of our cities and states.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/> <br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

It is inhumane and puts children, including American citizen children, at risk of homelessness.  The current practice of prorating housing assistance according to the number of eligible persons in the household is sensible and fair. To prevent anyone in the household from receiving assistance if a single member is ineligible is an attack on families, forcing them to expel members from the family unit or forcing entire families onto the streets.  It could also place an unnecessary burden on other social services, including child protective services, that are called on to meet needs arising from homelessness.  With the exception of abuse/neglect, children are far better off with their own families than in the foster care system.<br/><br/>The current system is workable and reasonable.  The proposed rule change bears the mark of ill intent toward our immigrant population and would punish persons who are lawfully eligible to receive housing assistance. Research has shown that while immigrants struggle to support themselves early on, their earnings increase dramatically in subsequent years. (bit.ly/Family-Immigration)  This rule change would push struggling families further down into poverty and delay their integration into American society as self sufficient members.  And it would punish children, the most vulnerable among us, including citizen children.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration, </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

Family unity should be considered a fundamental value and component of our immigration system. The proposed rule will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness.<br/><br/>The proposed rule is in direct conflict with federal policy priorities of ending homelessness and federal mandates for states to provide certain assistance and programs to everyone. For example, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) has prioritized ending and preventing homelessness among families with children, regardless of immigration status. The proposed rule directly contradicts this policy goal by erecting additional barriers to housing access. Furthermore, the rule is in conflict with the National Affordable Housing Acts edict to ensure that every American family be able to afford a decent home in a suitable environment.<br/><br/>People who lose their housing due to the proposed rule will have a very challenging time time finding housing they can afford. In Illinois, there are just 35 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income renter households. Moreover, seventy-two percent of extremely low-income renter households are severely housing cost-burdened, spending more than half of their income on housing, with little left over for other basic necessities. This puts them on the brink, just one financial setback away from eviction and homelessness.<br/><br/>Although HUD acknowledges the potential costs of homelessness in their Regulatory Impact Analysis, noting that temporary and long-term homelessness is a likely for many families because of the proposed rule, it has not provided a detailed analysis of this economic impact.

This measure will marginalize immigrants and relatives of immigrants and is discriminatory by nature. Individuals have the right to safe housing no matter their immigration status or any other characteristic. The cost of housing, which is far outstripping wage growth in my community in Western North Carolina already makes it incredibly difficult for low income families to remain stably housed. Enacting this law would only further that crisis. <br/><br/>I work for a non profit agency that seeks to end homelessness in our community and the statistics have shown consistently that homelessness places a great economic strain on our communities. When individuals are housed their utilization of emergency services decreases almost by half. Jail rates show similar trends. Both of these significantly affect all individuals in the community as our tax money must be allocated towards those needs. Housing individuals is a much more humane, but also more economically advantageous option. <br/><br/>I urge the government to seek a more humane, practical and cost-effective response when seeking to address immigration issues.

We are an activist group composed of about 25 women who meet weekly.  MMOB opposes this proposed rule because it could result in the eviction of hundreds of thousands of hardworking Latino families.  UnidosUS estimated that federal and other subsidized housing programs lifted approximately 800,000 Latinos out of poverty in 2017.  If a household has one undocumented person and 4 legally documented persons, that person, perhaps an elderly parent, would have to leave the household.  What family is going to throw a loved family member?  We urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety, and that HUDs long-standing regulations remain in effect.<br/>Although HUD contends that the proposed rule is a means of addressing the waitlist crisis faced by a majority of Public Housing Authorities nationwide, MainStreet Moms (MMOB) recognizes that the proposed rule is a part of the current administrations coordinated attack on immigrant families. We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. Indeed, HUDs own analysis of the proposed rule concludes that fewer, not more, families are likely to receive assistance as a result of the rule. The real issue is the lack of sufficient funding to ensure that every family, regardless of immigration status, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home. <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>When I worked in after-school, I saw many children who relied on HUD, as opposed to the one's who were still on wait lists. It was clear that children with housing assistance were less stressed and hand decreased trauma due to the stability in their housing. We are a country that prioritizes families. We say that we have "family values." Yet this proposed rule flies into the face of these values. All families should not have to choose between housing assistance and staying together as a family. Families should not be penalized for their commitment to one another. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

The rule will result in over 55,000 children being evicted from their homes, and it would be harmful to childrens development and have implications for their well-being into adulthood. It would also increase the number of children living in poverty each year. <br/><br/>I have worked with families experiencing homelessness for 15 years and have seen subsidized housing work as a hand-up and not a hand-out for many families, including mixed-status immigrant families. Children in these families need stable housing in order to be productive in society. <br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development. Experiencing the stress of housing instability is harmful to young childrens development. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw its current proposal.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share. <br/><br/>While explicitly directed at families of mixed immigration status, it is, in fact, an assault on all people in this country in need of housing assistance. At a time when this country is facing an already unprecedented and rapidly increasing housing crisis, further threats to housing for people in need is thoughtless and cruel. There is no possible justification for the proposed rule. It must be withdrawn immediately.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Carol Voeller<br/>2480 Wayside Ter NE  Salem, OR 97301-9603</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to record my opposition to this malicious proposal that could lead to the eviction of over 100,000 people, including 55,000 children, from HUD-assisted housing.

According to a recent Washington Post article, this rule would lead to the eviction of more than 55,000 legal residents or citizen children. <br/><br/>As a pediatrician, I am see first hand the impacts of homelessness on the health and well being of children and their families. As is well known, access to housing is a social determinant of health. Children who lack stable housing are at risk for low birth weight, developmental delays, lead poisoning, asthma exacerbations, malnutrition, child abuse and emotional and psychological problems. These conditions have been well documented in the literature (Family Housing Fund report 1999, Pediatrics in Review "Effect of Homelessness on Children" October 2018, Science Times "Child Homelessness can have long-term consequences" 2016, to name a few) and are further substantiated by my own experiences in clinic.  One homeless, teen immigrant patient of mine developed high blood pressure and anxiety ever since he became homeless. Homelessness causes chronic stress which raises cortisol levels, disrupts blood sugar metabolism and contributes to long term illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. <br/><br/>Without a stable home in which to sleep and be safe, how can children attend school? Take their medicines? Function in society? <br/><br/>The Post article also mentioned that removing families of mixed immigration status from public housing and replacing with fully documented families would cost the government more money due to those families' access to higher subsidies. From an economics and housing perspective, this rule is flawed and will likely lead to more homelessness. As a resident of California, our state cannot afford another assault to our current homelessness crisis. <br/><br/>I urge the Department of Housing and Urban Development to put children first and stop the passage of this proposed rule. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Im strongly opposed to this rule is no fair because they want to separate families with childrens Americans citizens that they need this program to have a home .PLEASE THINK THEY ARE AMERICANS CITIZENS TOO NO MATTER IF THE PARENTS ARE LEGAL OR NOT THEY NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS HOUSING PROGRAM </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I don't want these families separated anymore.<br/>Felix Garavito<br/>90032</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">As the executive director of Door of Hope, a housing provider for formerly-homeless families, I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/> Current policy permits family members who are ineligible for housing subsidies to live in a home with their family members who are eligible for federal housing subsidies. The change in policy would affect mixed-status households receiving subsidies such as Section 8 housing vouchers and the Section 8 Project-Based Housing.  We believe that this change would have a negative impact on the overall homeless population in Los Angeles County as well as a direct impact on the families that Door of Hope serves. Below are a few examples of the possible consequences of this policy on the families we serve:<br/><br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>This change would severely limit the housing options for most of our undocumented families who we are currently serving.  All these families LEGALLY reside here, having filed for a special visa that protects undocumented domestic violence survivors.  They all fall under the category of mixed status since their children are citizens. The current policy has provided, although limited, housing options for these families.  The proposed change would deny them housing.<br/><br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>This policy would deny services to children who are U.S. citizens or Legal Permanent Residents.<br/><br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Families who have completed our program, who are currently housed under the mixed-status policy, would lose their housing and face possible homelessness once again.<br/><br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Limiting services based on mixed status could lead to other social service agencies adopting similar policies which would cause many of our families to lose basic services.<br/><br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Door of Hope could receive more undocumented families as other agencies implement the change and decide not to house undocumented families.<br/><br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>If Door of Hope decides not to accept these families, then we would leave vulnerable families experiencing domestic violence in even more difficult situations.<br/><br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The overall homeless population in Los Angeles County could increase if these families are forced out of their homes. This would make the shortage of available and affordable housing worse than what it is now.<br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

It is inexcusable for a wealthy, powerful country like the United States to allow this. We could end homelessness if we made it a priority. <br/>This rule could add to the number of homeless in our community. The rule would leave some units unoccupied, so these families would not be replaced by other families. Even if every unit were filled after evicting these families, It makes no sense to remove someone from their home - especially children - in order to move someone else in.

The rule change will also force the difficult decision of family separation, such as an undocumented father having to leave his family in order to find housing elsewhere - a cruel situation.  In addition, section 5.514 (c)(ii) should not include the sentence which states that denial or termination of assistance be tied to a SAVE lack of verification - a situation which could be caused by SAVE system problems and have no relationship to the actions of the individual(s) applying for or receiving housing assistance.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This is a heinous and discriminatory bill designed to unnecessarily harm citizens of this country and should not be supported at all.

While it is true that alot of folks may be harmed, it can be proven that alot of folks can be helped.  The challenge with any undocumented individual is the inability to conduct a background check into assets and properties that maybe owned.  When any individual applies for subsidized housing personal and financial documents must be submitted and taken into account when trying to determine eligibility.  The biggest problem that affordable housing providers are encountering "hidden assets" "earned income."  Experience has been that some of our undocumented have properties and businesses across the border in their home states, how do you verify that information?  How do you verify the income earned from "cash" jobs?  If a documented person/family must provided proof of income and assets then an undocumented person/family should be made to follow those same requirements. There are major problems with fraud and they must be addressed to make it fair to everyone needing subsidized housing.  The other issue is verifying the accuracy of the "documents" being provided. Where this rule can cause harm it can also help weed out fraud. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

Neither undocumented immigrants nor documented immigrants without required eligibility status receive subsidies from HAs.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The current rules are in full compliance with the law, which states that financial assistance to mixed families must be prorated. Current law does not prohibit ineligible non-citizens from residing in assisted households.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The current rules around subsidy proration have been in place for more than two decades, and work effectively. There is no data to support the idea that ineligible non-citizens are receiving assistance.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Less than 1 percent of assisted households are mixed, and 0.5 percent of individuals in assisted households are ineligible for subsidy. This rule is a solution in search of a problem.<br/> <br/>Practicality<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>It is not practical to expect local judges in some states to support HAs attempting to evict families to comply with this federal rule when the families have not violated their lease.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Evicting families pursuant to the rule will cost local agencies significantly (HUD estimates between $3.3 and $4.4 million). As HUD is not providing funds for legal action and HAs have long been suffering under deeply prorated operating expense funding from Congress, this additional financial burden will make it harder to serve families and operate assistance programs effectively.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Implementing the rule will cost local agencies and HUD more in assistance payments, as mixed families pay a higher share of the rent compared to families comprised completely of eligible individuals. HUD estimates this rule will increase subsidy costs between $193 and $227 million. Congress is not proposing to appropriate additional funds and therefore HUD and local agencies will be able to assist fewer families.<br/> <br/>Fairness<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Mixed families have been admitted into housing programs according to the rules that HUD has promulgated. To now subject families to termination because of a reinterpretation of law is unacceptable.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The proposed rule suddenly makes families ineligible through no fault of their own. Moving the goalposts in this manner reflects a capricious method of policy making that is not consistent with a Department that seeks to administer Federal programs in a fair and just manner.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>This regulation will force thousands of households including 55,000 children into housing insecurity which is anathema to the stated goals of both HUD and HAs.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>HUD previously stated that the current rule strives to maintain the unity of the family, but the Departments new interpretation, as characterized by Secretary Carson, counts residency in a subsidized unit, even with a prorated subsidy, as a benefit in and of itself. This punitive action will not maintain the unity of affected families.<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Secretary Carson has said that the families on waiting lists deserve housing assistance and will benefit from this rule.

The proposed rule will cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. A significant number of these families include individuals and children who trying to rebuild their lives after being seriously impacted by domestic violence.  These children will be further traumatized if they are separated from their families or forced to become homeless to remain with their non-citizen family members.<br/><br/>I live in Los Angeles County and work for an agency that serves domestic violence survivors and their children, including providing these families with emergency shelter, transitional housing and access to affordable, safe long-term housing. I have personally witnessed how the ability to obtain federally-subsidized housing has improved the long-term stability of the families we serve and kept them from returning to an abusive situation.<br/><br/>Domestic violence survivors already face significant barriers to obtaining and maintaining housing after they leave an abusive relationship. These include economic instability and discrimination due to the violent acts of their abuser that often occur where the survivor lives. In fact, domestic violence is a primary factor that causes women to become homeless in our communities. The proposed rule creates another significant barrier for survivors who live in mixed-status families, which are common in our local community and throughout California. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of children in Los Angeles County, and nearly half of all children in California, live with foreign-born parents (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, Oct. 2017). Moreover, with half of all unsheltered Americans living in California, our state is also facing an unprecedented housing shortage and homelessness crisis. <br/><br/>The proposed rule forces low-income and vulnerable families to choose between breaking up their family and foregoing critical housing assistance, the loss of which could cause them to become homeless. The rule does nothing to help prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance, as the law already prohibits undocumented immigrants from accessing these subsidies. In fact, the list of ineligible immigrants under the proposed mixed-status rule includes people with legal immigration status, such as domestic violence survivors who were granted legal status after they cooperated with law enforcement in bringing their abuser to justice. <br/><br/>The only purpose served by the proposed rule is to increase fear among immigrant communities, unfairly penalize vulnerable families and children, and intensify an already critical housing and homelessness crisis in communities throughout our nation. For these reasons, I ask that HUD immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive rule. <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Access to affordable housing is fundamental to the health and vitality of a community. Everyone needs a safe, stable place to call home, and when that home is taken away not only will that family suffer but so too will the larger community as it absorbs the costs of families falling into instability and homelessness. While HUD argues that the proposed rule will help to address our affordable housing crisis, it could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. This is both cruel and counterproductive. HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits. At the same time, communities both urban and rural will then be dealing with the social costs of their residents who are evicted. Furthermore, millions of U.S. citizens currently receiving assistance will be affected by new documentation requirements which will put great strain on vulnerable people and great administrative costs on the public housing authorities and landlords who will have to implement those requirements.<br/><br/>"Mixed-status" families are already receiving prorated assistance that only goes to those who are eligible for assistance. This rule is unnecessary, costly and will in fact make our affordable housing crisis worse for local communities. I strongly urge the Adminstration to withdraw this rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>Access to affordable and stable housing is fundamental to family and community health, well-being, and dignity. Our communities and our country thrive when everyone has access to a high quality home. Immigrants and their families are vital parts of our social and economic fabric, and we should be building a housing system that creates the conditions for all of us to thrive. <br/><br/>This proposed HUD rule change would harm the health of immigrant families and of our communities as a whole, threatening people with evictions and homelessness and breaking families apart. <br/> - Public housing provides one crucial source of homes affordable to over 2 million low-income people in the US, and the evidence is clear that affordable housing supports health. <br/>- When families have to put too much of their income towards their rent, they cant afford to pay for other basic needs like food and health care, which is why problems like food insecurity increase along with housing costs, and many renters delay needed medical care because they cant afford it.<br/>- Thousands of immigrant families will be evicted from public housing under this proposal, which will have severe consequences for their health. <br/>- People who are evicted from their homes, or even threatened with eviction, are more likely to experience health problems like depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure than people with stable housing. They are also more likely to become homeless, contend with long-term housing instability, and visit an emergency room. <br/>- Eviction and other forms of housing instability, such as having to move frequently, are particularly harmful for children, which means that these rule changes would harm the health of many US citizen children living in mixed-status families. <br/>- Unstable housing means that kids are more likely to have behavioral problems and to struggle in school  and in classrooms where the student population changes quickly and frequently, all students can fall behind. <br/>- Education itself is linked to positive health outcomes and longer lives; thus, creating housing instability in childrens lives can have immediate and negative health impacts, but can also lead to poorer health across the lifecourse by disrupting their education.<br/><br/>This rule change would leave families with the terrible choice of either losing their housing or splitting up their family members. Rather than continuing to target and scapegoat immigrant and mixed status families, we should support public health and strengthen our communities by working to expand housing subsidies and supports for all low-income families.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">For more than 85 years, the Metropolitan Planning Council has worked to create prosperous, equitable and sustainable communities throughout the Chicago region by implementing solutions that result in vibrant neighborhoods, quality housing, and a strong economy. Because of our interest in a thriving Chicago region and our deep knowledge of the costs of racial inequity, MPC strongly opposes HUDs proposed rule to prohibit mixed status families from living in subsidized housing. This proposed change would deepen segregation in Chicago and undermine affordable housing, standing at direct odds with HUDs stated mission.<br/> <br/>In 2010, based on U.S. Census data, the Chicago region had the 5th highest combined racial and economic segregation and the 9th highest Latino-white segregation in the nation. Rather than addressing these issues of housing segregation, HUDs proposed rule would further disadvantage Chicagos  and indeed the countrys  Latino families. <br/> <br/>In Illinois, Latinos already face significant obstacles securing affordable housing compared to others. For example, according to U.S. Census data for 2016 in Illinois, regardless of income, 42.6% of White, non-Hispanic renter households spent 30% or more of their income on housing. By contrast, 48.4% of Hispanic renter households spent 30% or more of their income on housing.<br/> <br/>Historically, access to federal housing assistance has allowed hundreds of thousands of Latinos to lift themselves out of poverty. Yet the proposed rule would deter many eligible Latinos participating in public or subsidized housing programs, and increase housing insecurity for Latino families.<br/> <br/>Adoption of HUDs proposed rule directly violates the agencys statutory obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) mandates that the HUD Secretary shall administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of the FHA. In its 2015 regulation, HUD defined Affirmatively further fair housing to mean taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. The affirmatively furthering fair housing obligation also includes fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.<br/> <br/>HUD should not adopt the proposed rule.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity.<br/><br/>Can't the United States stand by its guiding principles, those which made us a haven for all who hungered for liberty, justice and all inalienable rights afforded to anyone who came to these shores as set in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

It is not only an abhorrent proposal that will result in an increase in homelessness, already a severe problem in this country, but will cause families to fracture and, by HUD's own studies, cause 55,000 children to live on the streets.  The costs to HUD, according to your own studies, will be $12.8 million to $17.4 million to implement this proposed rule and an additional $227 million annually for new subsidies for new tenants.  These increased taxpayer burdens will not improve the quality and quantity of public housing but will result in additional degradation of both.  Those funds could be more productively used to rid HUD buildings of lead and rodents &amp; to increase the numbers of housing units available to a very needy population.  Not everyone has been as lucky as Dr.Carson nor as gifted.  The need for sufficient &amp; adequate housing is very real and is critical to enabling families to start on a path to a better life and to become a more productive societal unit.<br/><br/>Further, the proposed rule does not comply with 42 USC section 1946a, reading the same as written.  The statute specifically addresses INDIVIDUALS and their own immigration status and requires proration in the case of families that include someone whose immigration status is not satisfactory under the terms of the law.  It is designed to encourage keeping families together, not separating them or forcing them into homelessness.  It begs understanding how HUD sees this rule as consistent with the spirit and language of the statute and the intent of Congress.  Adopting this rule will not only cause the additional and unnecessary costs mentioned previously, but will also result in litigation costs that HUD will undoubtedly incur in defending against the many lawsuits that will result to defeat this rule, as with so many rules adopted by this Administration.<br/><br/>I also object to the rule in NYC public housing (NYCHA) prohibiting persons who have served time in prison to reside in public housing with their families.  This also causes homelessness and increased crime, fractures families and punishes those who have already paid their debt to society by serving prison time.  <br/><br/>Please reconsider this proposed rule, in light of the existing housing crisis in this country, HUD's mission to resolve housing problems, not punish families, the increased costs this rule will entail and the litigation costs that will inevitably result.

As a physician I care for many families who may have one or two members of the family who have not yet attained legal status.  Members of the family that are citizens or have legal status often will not apply for benefits to which they are entitled because of this.  One family I care for springs to mind.  The mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and three young children were evicted when the mother ( who worked) got behind on her rent. ( The father, also an American citizen, had divorced the mother and had remarried.)  The great- grandmother, who came  to visit her family (who were all either citizens or awaiting citizenship finalization) had a stroke during her visit and the resulting hospital bills wiped out her great-granddaughter's savings. As a result of her illness, the great-grandmother also overstayed her visa.  The family became a mixed- status family.  This whole family lived in between shelters and their car for a year before they were finally housed.  During this time the grandmother and the children had repeated hospitalizations for illnesses that were exacerbated by their homelessness-- asthma, depression, complications of diabetes. The two young boys, 6-8, fell behind in school. When the family was finally housed  again, the hospitalizations stopped.  Being homeless takes a huge physical and mental toll and can have permanent effects, particularly on children.  Were HUDs new rules to go into effect this whole family ( again, most of whom are citizens) would be faced with either abandoning their great-grandmother and becoming homeless again.  I know, despite the hardships and terrible health consequences, that they would choose homelessness.  <br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

Los Angeles is facing a crisis of lack of housing which has led to a crisis of homelessness on our streets. This rule change would send thousands more Los Angeles residents to the brink of homelessness.  The city of Los Angeles and the state of California cannot stand any loss to housing affordability.  This rule change add to more homelessness which is a huge drain on Los Angeles, California, and Federal Resources.  This change will result in a huge waste of tax payer dollars due to the increased costs of dealing with the huge homeless population we have. <br/>HUDs own analysis shows the removal of prorated subsidies would cost HUD an estimated additional $193 to $227 million annually in order to serve the same number of individuals. This means that HUD would need Congress to either significantly  increase  funding  to  the  public  housing  and HCV programs or serve significantly fewer households.This  proposed change  forces  families  to  choose  between  separating  or  being  evicted  and  becoming vulnerable to homelessness. It will bring financial hardship onto more  families, and potentially weaken the  familial  and  social  networks  that  can help defend against  homelessness.  <br/>I urge the Administration to withdraw this proposal and instead work with local housing  providers  to  develop  policies  and  practices  that  are  safe,  supportive,  and  contribute  to healthy communities and residents.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am a social worker and therapist at a community health center and this proposed change to affordable housing regulations, <br/>I am certain, would negatively affect and jeopardize the mental and physical health of countless immigrant families.

They are taking them from American citizens who need the programs..... and have paid in for the establishment of the programs.  Our citizens.... both adults and children are homeless and sleeping on sidewalks and streets.  Many are our veterans who risked their lives for their country.  Those Americans need housing.  THEY should have a home!  <br/><br/>I applied for housing.  I worked all my life and paid my taxes.  Then the time came when I needed help for myself and my children.  I qualified for the housing program.  However..... there was no money left.  It had all been used up.  <br/><br/>Illegals sleep soundly in the housing that was MEANT FOR AMERICANS..... while Americans sleep in the gutters!  <br/><br/>Some are saying that we should be taking care of them and their children.

And they WILL go back.... or not even come here in the first place if America doesnt hand them everything on a silver platter!  Its not our responsibility to allow illegals to steal, abuse, and destroy our programs!  Its not our responsibility to take care of illegals in any way, shape, or form!  <br/>They are NOT Americans!  We cant even take care of our own citizens, our own children!  Why on Earth are we allowing OUR CHILDREN, our families, our veterans to suffer while we ignore them?  Why do we have to listen to the whining and efforts at guilt trips over poor illegals...... who SHOULD NOT EVEN BE ALLOWED TO BE HERE AT ALL!  They should go back to their OWN COUNTRY!  They are using us!  Wake up people!  <br/><br/>We have two children standing in front of us.  Both want a bed to sleep in.  One is an American citizen.  The other is an illegal who sneaked into our country illegally.  There is only one bed.  Currently.... we are giving the bed to the illegal.  We are pushing the American down onto the ground and walking away ..... walking away with our arms around the illegal, escorting him to his new bed. We just left behind the American citizen to sleep in the dirty gutter.  <br/><br/>If we really want to be caring people, we should go back and pick up the American and take him to the bed.  If the illegal has a need or a problem, then he should go back to his country and ask them for whatever he wants or needs.  And if he knows next time that this will happen, then just perhaps he wont bother to come back illegally.  <br/><br/>Taking care of our American citizens is the caring thing to do.  Taking care of our American citizens is our responsibility.  Taking care of illegals is not our responsibility.

The new proposed rule, however, will raise barriers to those aims. <br/><br/>If enacted, the rule could increase the risk of homelessness for many otherwise eligible citizens and family members including 55,000 children and many others. Since stable housing is a fundamental building block for family and community health, this ruling will lead to long-term negative impacts on our nation's health and wellbeing. I am also concerned that this rule would force housing authorities to divert extremely limited resources from providing shelter to children, seniors, veterans, and families to an unnecessary administrative process, and will result in fewer eligible families receiving assistance. <br/><br/>As your department reviews the next steps, I ask that you end consideration of removing the eligibility of mixed-status families from receiving the assistance.

According to HUDs own analysis, the proposed rule would target, and most likely displace, about 2,800 immigrant families in New York City who live in public housing or receive rental subsidies. In total, about 11,400 people in NYC could be evicted from their homes, almost half of them -- about 4,900 -- children. This change would directly impact both the community in which I live and the one where I work by forcing many of my neighbors and friends into homelessness. The importance of public housing subsidies for these families cannot be understated as they serve a paramount role in keep communities intact over the long term as people suffer from unemployment, or health crises, or other unexpected financial emergencies. Writing this comment is only one way I work with Jacob Riis Settlement to help immigrant communities across the country face unprecedented discrimination and insecurity while trying to making a better life for themselves.

The rule will result in over 55,000 children being evicted from their homes, and it would be harmful to childrens development and have implications for their well-being into adulthood. It would also increase the number of children living in poverty each year. <br/><br/>I see parents and grandparents coming to a food pantry at our church.  Some households swell when single parents and children need to leave their homes, not necessarily due to immigration rules, but due to life events beyond their control.  They leave their homes empty-handed and need to rebuild their lives from scratch.  If they are lucky, there are other family members who can take them in.  That's not always possible for immigrant families.  All young children need the security of loving family members.  If families cannot live together in stable  housing situations, both children and adults suffer.  They lose family patterns of sleep, shared meals, routines of work and schooling, supportive friendships at work and school and neighborhoods.  Split family units may lack furnishings, beds and bedding, clothing, food staples, cleaning supplies, transportation, childcare, throwing their lives into chaos and poverty.<br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development. Experiencing the stress of housing instability is harmful to young childrens development. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw its current proposal. We need to invest in children, rather than put their healthy development and education at risk by provoking fear and destabilizing their families.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Please do not bring to fruition this proposed law and do not separate families.

Our perspective is informed through interactions with our many base-building grassroots partners around the United States, who are committed to housing justice - housing as a human right by which all people are able to access high-quality, safe, and affordable housing. Among our network, housing justice is the second-most frequent social determinant of health for which our base-building partners are advocating and organizing. Our base-building partners work every day to keep families together by preserving, protecting and creating safe and affordable housing access. We are concerned that the proposed rule would diminish these efforts by separating families - or worse, putting children and others on the street.<br/>Further, this rule is predicated on Executive Order 13828, Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility. The EO states that our country was founded on principles of freedom and equal opportunity towards self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility. Diminishing children and families access to a roof over their heads, separating families and evicting individuals and families all contradict these principles.<br/>Housing stability for low-income residents is a vital social determinant of health and broader community economic stability. We already know that evictions are a health equity issue - increasing rates of evictions disproportionately impact Black women and their children. In addition, even the threat of eviction leads individuals to report poor health, high blood pressure, depression, anxiety and distress relative to people who experience stable housing. The results of evictions - including overcrowding, homelessness and emergency room visits - also demonstrate various negative health outcomes for adults and children.<br/>Eviction and other forms of housing instability, such as having to move frequently, are particularly harmful for children, which means that these rule changes would harm the health of many children living in mixed-status families. Unstable housing means that children are more likely to have behavioral problems and to struggle in school  and in classrooms where the student population changes quickly and frequently, all students can fall behind. Education itself is linked to positive health outcomes and longer lives: thus, creating housing instability in childrens lives can have immediate and negative health impacts, but can also lead to poorer health across the lifecourse by disrupting their education.<br/>When families have to put too much of their income towards their rent, they cannot afford to pay for other basic needs like food and health care. Hence, problems like food insecurity increase along with housing costs, and many renters delay needed medical care because they cant afford it.<br/>Through its anticipated impact in terms of evictions, this proposal also violates basic just cause principles which have been codified by various cities and states - often as a result of concerted effort by housing justice advocates and partly in response to the fact that evictions have the greatest impact on low-income and Black residents.<br/>Ripping families away from stable housing, or tearing families apart so that only some members can have a home while other do not, have severe and deadly public health outcomes - not just for the families, but for our society. We cannot have healthy, thriving communities by increasing separation and/or displacement and housing instability of low-income children and families.<br/>For these reasons, The Miami Workers Center urges the Department to rescind this dangerous proposal which would leave families with no other choice but to either lose their homes or split up their family members. We ask that the Department instead promote policies that support access to high-quality, safe, and affordable housing as a human right.<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly oppose HUDs new proposed rule that is very cruel, harmful and will have a huge negative impact on our community.

I think the new rule will cause more damage to our economy and family structure.   <br/> <br/>We should stand together, build capacity and have a strong advocacy to oppose the new rule.

This is a cruel and arbitrary change, and as HUD knows, it would most likely cause about 2,800 immigrant families in New York City to lose their homes. This means that in total about 11,400 people in NYC could be evicted, about 4,900 of whom are children. <br/><br/>Low-income, and especially immigrant, families in New York City already struggle for subsistence, to the detriment of our community. Everyone in our community, particularly those most vulnerable, deserve to have safe shelter.This proposed change puts so many people at risk, and is unnecessary. It is a direct attack on immigrant families.<br/><br/>What's more, HUD's own analysis found that shelter subsidies for families facing homelessness, after being evicted because of this rule change, could cost taxpayers between $20,000 to $50,000 per person--so this arbitrary change could cost taxpayers millions of dollars, while doing nothing to address the housing crisis in our city.<br/><br/>I ask the Administration to withdraw this proposal to prevent the long-term negative repercussions that this change would have on generations to come.<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

This proposed mixed status rule by HUD is simply unfair and I strongly oppose it from being enforced in a way that puts families at risk. Receiving public housing benefits is a basic human right of eligible immigrants and residents. From my personal experience, when I came into this country back in 2003 with my mother and younger brother, we lived with our grandparents, who are U.S. citizens, in public housing and we were just immigrants seeking asylum approval. If mixed status rule was implemented back in 2003, then my family would become homeless and not live with my grandparents. Eventually, we got an apartment within the same public housing development as a legal NYS resident. <br/><br/>The proposed mixed status rule will not only separate families but will increase the number of people experiencing homelessness in NYC. Currently, NYC has 63,000 people experiencing homelessness, the proposed rule will increase the street homeliness in NYC by getting 25,000 more people evicted out of their house. . The last thing that NYC needs is more people going in to shelter and utilizing emergency rooms. This proposed rule may also take away available affordable housing, where landlords may not willing to offer or accept section 8 vouchers.

Undocumented immigrants are already not assisted by HUD. This rule only impacts families of mixed immigration status, punitively impacting those who do have eligible status because of the status of their family members- something they may have zero control over. <br/><br/>This impact of this will look like undocumented parents being less comfortable accessing help with housing for their citizen children. It's going to look like fewer low income residents (who do have eligible status) by increasing the overall average cost of assisted households. It's going to look like citizens getting evicted from their homes because they can't live without their breadwinner, and their breadwinner can't live with them. It's going to look like discrimination because in certain states, the majority of the undocumented immigrants are people of color.<br/><br/>As a person who calculates these prorated rents, I get the temptation to just simplify the paperwork with an all or nothing policy.

Thus allowing the parents to claim benefits including public housing as well as send their children to a public school without contributing tax income to the cost of the schooling. It seems if the government were to alter the regulations and laws slightly around enrolling your children in public schooling without having parents legally residing in the United States it was more than likely deter a lot of families from attempting to even come over. But also acted in method of reporting undocumented citizens back to the government. There are an undeniable amount of illegal immigrants that do rightfully deserves citizenship status have contributed to our society and are law-abiding citizens as well as a handful of children who came over at a very very young age all they know is America however they're denied citizenship.

The change will likely affect immigrants of all statuses and the U.S. citizens with whom they live. As an employee of Los Angeles County, a change in the eligibility requirements for assisted housing programs is especially important to the communities I work and live in. In fact, 3.6 million people 36 percent of Los Angelenos are foreign born, and 58 percent of all children under 18 in LA County have at least one immigrant parent. Los Angeles is also home to many mixed-status families, whose lives should be taken into account. Of all LA County families, 16 percent are composed of at least one undocumented family member and another member that is a legal permanent resident or citizen. These numbers are from a December 2018 report by our researchers at Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.<br/> <br/>The danger of a policy change like the one proposed is that it also has the power to affect public health and safety for everyone in our communities. For example, an anti-immigrant policy such as this is likely to create fear among these populations and cause people to keep their families away from government agencies, and services for fear of jeopardizing themselves and revealing their status. This fear could prevent individuals from accessing assisted housing programs, jeopardizing family and housing stability, and placing families at risk of homelessness. Allowing immigrant communities safe and secure access to housing will enable them to participate and contribute to their families. <br/><br/>With approximately nine percent of Americas immigrants living in Los Angeles County, I have a special interest in this issue. LA County leaders recognize that providing opportunities, encouraging civic engagement, and being open to immigrants and all members of our communities, means healthier and safer communities for all. Communities across the country stand to benefit a great deal from having stable, thriving, and active immigrant community members more fully integrated into social and economic life. A shift in the eligibility requirements of these assisted housing programs as proposed by this rule will complicate immigrant integration efforts  and it will reaffirm exclusion and difference at a time when inclusive and common ground are key. <br/><br/>Concerns about rule changes raised by immigrant advocates, local leaders, and housing experts in Los Angeles and around the country are well founded, and should be given due consideration in the debates ahead.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Dr. Kim Tabari<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Dear Secretary Ben Carson,<br/><br/>I am writing to express strong opposition to the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule that would prohibit mixed-status families from living in subsidized housing.

My parents lived undocumented for my childhood years and they paid into the economy by paying sales tax and filing their income taxes every single year despite living in fear and knowing they would NEVER reap benefit of social security. It is better for the community and society as a whole to provide support services rather than to pull away from them in order for their to be less homelessness and more economic growth.<br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. The real issue is the lack of funding to ensure that every family, including mixed-income immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Do NOT implement this new rule!

HUD's own report concluded that more homelessness (estimated to cost $20,000 to $50,000 a year, per individual) is likely. 108,000 people would be affected and 70% of the affected are citizens or legal residents and 55,000 are children (children here legally). The HUD analysis estimates that this proposal would cost the government as much as $227 million a year. HUD also reports that the extra cost is money that Congress would be unlikely to appropriate.  Not only that, the analysis reports few benefits for other low-income families waiting for aid this proposed rule.<br/><br/>This proposal will result in housing disruption, homelessness, and family separation. I am a psychotherapist and I can promise you homelessness and family separation has a terrible cost to families and particularly children. These are known to expand  medical and social problems like mental health, chronic illness management, increase Emergency Room use, gangs, crime, and the sex industry. Children, adolescents and young adults are vulnerable populations that need protection not displacement. Homelessness in these populations can lead to crime, sex traffic, gangs and other social ills. Need for community safety, law enforcement, the criminal justice system, and medical centers will grow.<br/><br/>HUD is responsible to we the people of the USA. The increased burden to our healthcare system, law enforcement and judicial system will be costly in more ways than just financially. As HUD's own analysis has reported this is a bad proposal. Why is HUD proposing the rule change? Is this political, as all things seem to be these days? Citizens, legal residents, families, children, the poor should not be used as pawns. Tens of thousands of poor children could lose their housing and all of them American citizens or legal residents. HUD has determined it would actually cost money. This is an ill thought-out proposal. Actually it is worse than ill thought-out since HUD did an impact analysis. It is mean-spirited, cruel and irrational. Follow the analysis impact and reject this. <br/><br/>P.S.

Founded in 2000, the mission and work of UUSJ is grounded in the principles of the Unitarian Universalist faith which recognize the inherent worth and dignity of every person, the responsibility of the larger community to seek justice, equity and compassion in human relations, and the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part. UUSJ seeks to mobilize and amplify the voices of UUs throughout the nation on matters of federal public policy. Nearly all of our social justice activities are based on these foundational principles, and thus inform our actions regarding immigration. We believe that many of the current policies of the United States Government are antithetical to a just, moral and equitable system of immigration of persons seeking to enter and remain in the United States of America. <br/><br/>We offer the following comments on the proposed rule referenced above:<br/><br/>This rule change that HUD has proposed is one of those policies that we believe are harmful to immigrants, especially those undocumented immigrants with children and/or other family members who are citizens or otherwise authorized by law to live in public housing. HUDs own estimate is that, if made final, this rule change could result in the eviction of up to 55,000 citizen children currently living in HUD subsidized housing.  This is cruel, unnecessary and simply unacceptable.  The current interpretation of Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 is a sensible one: that if an undocumented leaseholder in HUD housing has family members who are citizens or otherwise authorized then the family may continue to live in such housing, though the subsidy is prorated to reflect the ineligibility of assistance to undocumented individuals in the household. <br/><br/>This proposed change simply seeks to severely punish impoverished families of mixed immigration status. In addition, we believe this change would cause a sharp increase in homelessness, as many of those evicted would lack the financial resources to lease other kinds of housing. Such homelessness would inevitably result in some children entering state child welfare systems which are already overwhelmed with children who are neglected and/or abused. We believe this to be an unacceptable outcome, especially for a nation that prides itself on being family friendly. <br/><br/>For the above reasons, UUSJ asks that HUD withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">The proposed rule change means that families will have to choose between being evicted or breaking up the family.

The rule will result in over 55,000 children being evicted from their homes, and it would be harmful to childrens development and have implications for their well-being into adulthood. This is wrong.<br/><br/>I also want to draw a paralell. This war against immigrant families is very similar to the war against Native Americans that drove them from their homes at the beginning of this nation's history. Have we learned nothing? Many of the immigrant families from Mexico and South America are indigenous people who have been directly harmed and had their livlihoods taken from them due to more than 50 US military actions in South America over the last 100 years, NAFTA in Mexico and the oppression of corporate powers. Indigenous people of the western hemisphere continue to be attacked and now under the guise of anti-immigrant legislation - the government wants to make families and children homeless. This must stop. I am calling for an end to the oppression of immigrant families in our nation and an end to the sustained attacks on indigenous people by this government.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw its current proposal. We need to invest in children, rather than put their healthy development and education at risk by provoking fear and destabilizing their families.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This proposed rule tramples the rights of children, who are US citizens, living with their families. I disagree with this rule becoming the final rule. It needs to be emphasized that the current rule does not use HUD or any other federal dollars to subsidize the non eligible family member. In all cases, the non eligible family member will have his/her income used to calculate the rent that he/she will pay as an individual to live with his/her subsidy- eligible family member(s). <br/>To have a family choose between being evicted in order to live together, separating from their children, or becoming homeless are all cruel and untenable choices. Will paying for children in foster care be less expensive than housing them together with their family under the current rule? Should we force families to become homeless? What about the unintended consequences when families are evicted and the local schools lose their enrollment on which it depends to run the school? <br/>My mother and my grandmother came to this great country as immigrants at time when becoming a citizen was much faster and easier. Stop treating immigrants as less than human. I admire my mother and grandmother for making the US their home to provide a better life for me and the rest of family.  The current rule is a better, more humane and less expensive way to support low-income family unity in this country. <br/>A comprehensive overall of the US Immigration System needs to done in a humane way.

Everyone deserves the right to housing, no matter their immigration status. We urge the rule to be withdrawn in its entirety, and that HUDs long-standing regulations remain in effect.<br/>The YWCA provides emergency housing, long-term housing, supportive living and Young Adult Services.   If we allow this proposed rule is allowed than many people will be displaces and cause further strain on an already vastly homeless population.  <br/>Although HUD contends that the proposed rule is a means of addressing the waitlist crisis faced by a majority of Public Housing Authorities nationwide, YWCA recognizes that the proposed rule is a part of the current administrations coordinated attack on immigrant families. We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. Indeed, HUDs own analysis of the proposed rule concludes that fewer, not more, families are likely to receive assistance as a result of the rule. The real issue is the lack of sufficient funding to ensure that every family, regardless of immigration status, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home. <br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>The proposed rule threatens to undermine the well-being of low-income U.S. citizens, immigrants, and their families. The rule would force mixed status families to make an impossible decisioneither break up to allow eligible family members to continue receiving assistance or forgo the subsidies so that the families can stay together. Family separations undermine family stability, and leads to toxic stress, trauma, and attachment issues in children. Even a temporary separation has an enormous negative impact on the health and educational attainment of these children later in life, and many parents struggle to restore the parent-child bond once it has been disrupted by a separation. <br/>Sincerely<br/>April Allen <br/>YWCA Rochester Ny <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs rule to prohibit mixed-status immigrant families from living in subsidized housing.

Brooke of Massachusettsand later as his chief of staff, before entering the private practice of law in Washington, D.C. I wrote two pieces of housing legislation as part of the Housing and Urban Development Acts of 1969 and 1970: the Brooke Amendment relating to public housing; and the national Housing Allowance program, which morphed into the Section 8 housing program that has helped millions of Americans.<br/><br/>Indeed, I dedicated my newest law review articlewhich was just published, and is attached to this submissionto the memory of Senator Brooke who was the Senate sponsor of this landmark housing legislation, and without whom it would never have come into being. The senator told me one day that he was concerned about the plight of public housing tenants in Massachusetts, especially the elderly. Hence, I went to work and tried to determine what could be done; and the rest is history.<br/><br/>At no time was it ever envisioned that illegal immigrants would occupy federally-funded public housing, or be recipients of any federal aid under the Brooke Amendment or the voucher program that today is Section 8or any other federal housing program. This has been the consistent thread that has run through such programs since their inception. Either American laws matter or they dont. No exceptions can or should be made.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to comment on the proposed rule change to deny mixed status families ability to live in public/subsidized housing.

Usually because the way those work, they take out a large amount, (20-50k), and end up using it to purchase cars, a new roof, vacation etc.  Lake County has a tax deferral program, allowing a senior to defer the taxes up to $5000.  This is charged 6% simple interest, about $300 each year.  A lien is placed on the home and when sold by surviving family members, the amount is paid to the County.  Unfortunately, this cannot be done if there is an existing reverse mortgage on the title.   Some of the reverse mortgage companies pray upon the seniors and leave them with no equity in their home.<br/><br/>This leads to the seniors not having any money within a few years and now has an emergency to find somewhere to live.  There is currently about a five year wait for housing assistance through HUD in Lake County.  These individuals have worked most of their lives, paid taxes into the system and when they need help, are unable to get any. This is not the way it should be. <br/><br/>I would propose to give assistance in the following order with Veterans of the U.S. Military or Veteran of World War II born in another country<br/><br/>Seniors who are disabled (Legalized, and US born)<br/>Seniors over 75 &amp; Disabled individuals unable to work  (Legalized, and US born)  <br/>Disabled who can work part time  (Legalized, and US born) <br/>Seniors over 65 (Legalized, and US born)<br/>US born citizens <br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Individuals with 3 plus children and working<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Individuals with 1 plus children and working <br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Individuals with 3 plus children and not working<br/><span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>Individuals with 1 plus children and not working<br/>Legalized immigrants(using the same guide as US born)<br/>Mixed families (using he same guide as US Born)<br/><br/>I would suspect after the seniors, veterans and the disabled are identified and put into the program as they should be, there would not be as many spots left for the able bodied.  We need to prioritize our seniors and disabled. Only if there are spots open, <br/>no one should be given a HUD voucher. The longer the person is in the USA contributing to the economy, the higher the preference should be, unless the individual is disabled.  <br/><br/>The other comment I had was about the new documentation requirements. Individuals on programs all, already have these documents available for presentation.  This is something you need for many areas of assistance.  Everyone would have a birth<br/>certificate or access to one.  I think the presenter protested too much.

The proposed rule will cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status. A significant number of these families include individuals and children who trying to rebuild their lives after being seriously impacted by domestic violence.<br/><br/>I live in Los Angeles County and work for an agency that serves domestic violence survivors and their children, including providing these families with emergency shelter, transitional housing and access to affordable, safe long-term housing. I have personally witnessed how the ability to obtain federally-subsidized housing has improved the long-term stability of the families we serve and kept them from returning to an abusive situation. <br/><br/>Domestic violence survivors already face significant barriers to obtaining and maintaining housing after they leave an abusive relationship. These include economic instability and discrimination due to the violent acts of their abuser that often occur where the survivor lives. In fact, domestic violence is a primary factor that causes women to become homeless in our communities. The proposed rule creates another significant barrier for survivors who live in mixed-status families, which are common in our local community and throughout California. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of children in Los Angeles County, and nearly half of all children in California, live with foreign-born parents (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, Oct. 2017). Moreover, with half of all unsheltered Americans living in California, our state is also facing an unprecedented housing shortage and homelessness crisis. <br/><br/>The proposed rule forces low-income and vulnerable families to choose between breaking up their family and foregoing critical housing assistance, the loss of which could cause them to become homeless. The rule does nothing to help prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance, as the law already prohibits undocumented immigrants from accessing these subsidies. In fact, the list of ineligible immigrants under the proposed mixed-status rule includes people with legal immigration status, such as domestic violence survivors who were granted legal status after they cooperated with law enforcement in bringing their abuser to justice. <br/><br/>The only purpose served by the proposed rule is to increase fear among immigrant communities, unfairly penalize vulnerable families and children, and intensify an already critical housing and homelessness crisis in communities throughout our nation.

At least 25,000 households, or 108,000 people, would become ineligible for subsidized housing because of a single non-citizen/resident family member. Among that number are 55,000 children of US citizenship whose parents would no longer be able to sign a lease. The proposed rule change would literally force families and citizens into homelessness. <br/>There is also no financial justification for the plan, as subsidies are already pro-rated to cover only those that are eligible. Requiring that all family member be legal US residents will increase subsidy costs to an exorbitant degree, which, per HUD's analysis, will actually reduce the quality and quantity of assisted housing. This in no way meets HUD's stated purpose of providing more services to those who are eligible or of reducing wait times for citizens/residents in dire need. <br/>Overall, the proposed rule change is poorly conceived and seems designed only to inflict suffering on the needy in an attempt to score political points. It is appalling to me as a citizen, voter, and taxpayer that some within the Department of Housing and Urban Development would attempt to ignore the department's own analysis as to the costs and defects of the proposed rule. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I oppose the proposed changes to section 214.

As a taxpayer, I am completely satisfied seeing my taxes assist mixed-status families, as under current rule.  As a mother, I am very concerned about seeing children (US Citizens usually but that does not matter) thrust out of low-income subsidized housing when so few other options exist, as that housing is key to their access to basic education and their health.  As a Unitarian-Universalist advocate for the inherent worth and dignity of every human being, I find this proposed change to be morally wrong and yet another sneaky way to harass immigrants who are trying very hard to escape poverty and violence in their former countries and who are among the most industrious workers -- a key element of our economy and society.

I agree with the proposed changes because they will bring policy more in line with Section 214.<br/><br/>It is currently held that U.S. citizens who have committed certain criminal acts cannot take part in HUD sponsored rental assistance programs or public housing.  If someone currently on housing brings an unauthorized person into their assisted rental unit, they can have their voucher terminated/revoked.  It is unfair, then, to allow illegal aliens, who are - by definition - criminals, to hold a voucher for Section 8 rental assistance or take part in public housing.<br/><br/>Why should non-citizens, who are primarily in this country illegally, be allowed to take part in taxpayer funded programs?  Why should people who choose to criminally break the laws of the land be rewarded for their bad/criminal behavior?<br/><br/>Vouchers for Section 8 rental assistance and access to public housing should be reserved for citizens.<br/><br/>I also disagree with the notion that just because an illegal alien manages to get across the border and pop out a baby that the child automatically gets to be a U.S. citizen.  Ridiculous.  The child is the spawn of a criminal and both should be deported immediately from whence they came.  If a U.S. citizen has a child abroad, that child is considered a U.S. citizen.  Likewise, if a foreigner has a child abroad, that child should be considered a citizen of the same country as their mother, NOT of the country in which their parent visited, or illegally entered.<br/><br/>Please reign in the practice of allowing generation after generation of "mixed" families and illegal aliens to take part in taxpayer funded housing programs.<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

It's important to note that subsidies are already calculated excluding any ineligible family members, and ineligible members may include legal immigrants as well as undocumented ones. The effect of the proposed rule change, as admitted by HUD itself in its analysis, will be to either force families to forgo subsidies and assistance themselves - likely including many families who are in fact still eligible - or to force families to separate. <br/><br/>It is profoundly inappropriate for a government agency to try to force families to separate by withholding financial assistance. Separation of parents from eligible children is likely to lead to permanently breaking up families, a variety of problems related to trauma for children, and further issues because of the removal of income or household labor from ineligible adults. <br/><br/>Due to both separation of families and removal of housing assistance, both children and adults in affected families are likely to become increasingly vulnerable to poverty, homelessness, and associated health problems. In addition to the severe negative effects on the families themselves, these problems have a tendency to spiral outwards and affect entire communities; homeless people have more health problems and are more likely to use the emergency room due to inadequate medical access and be unable to pay their bills, which results in increasing costs for other users of the local hospital system and the government, for one example.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">ANGELICA ESQUIVEL<br/><br/>SOY UN RESIDENTE DE VIVIENDA PUBLICA QUE ME GUSTARIA QUE NO ME AFECTE LA NUEVA LEY QUE  QUIEREN <br/><br/>APROBAR PARA   PARA LAS FAMILIAS MIXTAS PORQUE SERIA UN INPACTO MUY GRANDE EN MI VIDA Y EN LAS VIDAS <br/>DE MUCHAS FAMILIAS QUE HEMOS VIVIDO EN VIVIENDA PUBLICA PORQUE BASADO EN MIS INGRESOS NO PODRIA<br/>PAGAR UN ALQUILER MUY ALTOY<br/>  e</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">As someone who works with homelessness programs data and has been inspired by the efforts of HUD and other professionals in the field to identify and address racial and ethnic disparities in services delivery, I am especially appalled by this proposed rule. This rule would only serve to harm U.S. citizens and their families who are already paying higher rents in subsidized housing; it would punish them for having in their household someone with an undocumented status even though the prorated rent already ensures that the benefit is only being provided to U.S. citizens from a cost perspective. <br/><br/>It is especially unconscionable that this would directly harm children and lead to homelessness for many of those impacted by this proposed rule. It seems incredibly contradictory that HUD would evict families or households due to the undocumented status of one person and directly contribute to the burden of solving and ending homelessness taken on by service providers and agencies that receive HUD funding. <br/><br/>I cannot put into strong enough terms my opposition to this proposed rule. According to HUDs own analysis, implementing it would cost the government as much as $227 million a year and reduce housing assistance available across the board. When you drill down into the analysis of this rule and all of the concurrent negative impacts it would have, the only justification for it is this administrations efforts to destroy and terrorize immigrant families.  <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Driving tens of thousands of people into homelessness does not make our communities safer.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I Oppose HUD-2019-0044-0001 <br/>The Public and Affordable Housing Research Corp said about 1.6 million families are looking for subsidized housing.

Additionally, this rule would directly lead to at least 55,000 children who are citizens or legal residents losing their housing. The effects of homelessness on children are well documented, particularly in the landmark ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences) Study.

Please accept my comments and opposition in the strongest possible terms to this rule change that will threaten the health and well-being of families of immigrants, communities of color, and citizen and noncitizen children. <br/><br/>I am the Director of Innovative Partnerships at Childrens HealthWatch. Our network is committed to improving children's health in America. Every day, in urban hospitals across the country, we collect data on children ages zero to four, many of whom are from families experiencing economic hardship. Over the past 20 years, we have surveyed more than 70,000 caregivers. We analyze our data and release our findings to researchers, legislators, and the public to inform public policies and practices that can give all children and their families equal opportunities for healthy, successful lives. <br/><br/>Decades of research shows that living in a stable home is important for achieving optimal health. When children live in families experiencing housing instability and homelessness, they are more likely to have poor physical, mental, and cognitive health compared to children in stable homes. , , , , , ,   Federal housing programs are specifically designed, however, to mitigate these risks and provide stable, affordable homes for families with low incomes. These program are effective in not only reducing homelessness and housing instability, but also in reducing poverty and helping families with low incomes afford basic needs. <br/><br/>The proposed changes to section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 will threaten the health of children, including citizen children, and likely have lasting effects on the health of communities across our country. The changes proposed are specifically designed to force families to make choices that will harm their childs health; mixed status families would have to make the excruciating decision to either face eviction or separate as a family in order to retain housing stability. Both options will have lasting impacts on child and family health and are costly to our health care and education systems. <br/><br/>The changes outlined in this proposed rule are harmful to the children, particularly children of color, in this country. Evicting families or forcing them to separate will not only harm childrens health today, but well into the future. We need policies that expand, not reduce, access to stable homes for families with children in order to ensure all children have opportunities to be healthy and reach their highest potential. For these reasons, I urge the Department to immediately withdraw in full this harmful proposal.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Richard Sheward<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly object to HUD's proposed rule to evict all undocumented immigrants from public housing as part of a plan that could impact tens of thousands of undocumented parents and their U.S. citizen children.<br/><br/>This rule is inhumane and un-American.

I urge that the rule be withdrawn in its entirety. The rule will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families, including about 62,400 women and girls. <br/><br/>This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share. Also this is blatant disregard for why our immigrant families chose to flee their native lands and seek refuge in the United States.  Clearly this administration believes in making life as an immigrant in our country  a country whose foundation rests on Immigrants  as difficult as possible. <br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Again, another example of how this administration chooses to make life as an immigrant in our country of immigrants as difficult as possible.  <br/>Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.  <br/><br/>My father as a young child came to this country with his siblings and mother in the early 1900's during the massive wave of immigration at the turn of the century.  I was told their stories of hardship in the early days of their residence. Nothing in their lives bears any resemblance to what these current immigrants are experiencing.  My grandfather came for a job in industry; he and his fellow immigrants worked hard and eked out a living for their families. They were not separated from their children. They were not threatened with deportation. They were not locked up in holding cells.  Although life was hard and challenging, yet they stayed, were treated with respect, contributed to the community, raised their children who became citizens, and died and are buried in US soil.<br/><br/>Would that today's immigrants not be threatened with the respect and dignity that my father's family experienced.   Hence, HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing. <br/><br/>The Trump administration needs to immediately withdraw this cruel proposed rule and instead move forward toward family unity and dignity. Stop creating unnecessary roadblocks in their lives. <br/><br/>The Trump administration needs to remember and focus on the reality that we are all the descendants of immigrants...... including Mr. Trump.  This requires a certain degree of humility and recognition of our common origins in other countries. This is the basis of the principles used to welcome and provide for the needs of our immigrant families.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jane Toth<br/>4330 Tamalga Dr  South Euclid, OH 44121-3522</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I urge you to protect mixed-status families who are living in subsidized housing.

Subsidies are forbidden from supporting illegal immigrants and mixed families (legal and illegal immigrants) have to pay much higher rents. Further, HUD's only data shows that the evictions would not benefit any families on waiting lists. <br/><br/>Point in fact: there is no benefit to the rule and nearly 100,000 people including 55,000 children who are poor would lose their housing. This is unconscionable. <br/><br/>I am the executive director of a small non-profit organization providing housing for people with disabilities and low incomes and I understand the effect of the proposed rule if any of our tenants would lose their housing especially if there is no real advantage to anyone. Unstable families are the result, using other public resources and costing much more than if they were stably housed. <br/><br/>In our community, we are over 2300 units short of being able to affordably house everyone at 30% of the area median income.

There is absolutely no evidence that indicates this proposed rule will save money or make more units available.  In fact, evidence points to this proposed rule forcing thousands of eligible residents out of public housing. I urge HUD to withdraw this rule.<br/><br/>I live in Schenectady, NY, a city built by immigrants.  Currently, we have a significant shortage of affordable housing.  If HUD is truly concerned with ensuring affordable housing is available to more eligible families, increase funding so that the thousands on the Section 8 waiting list can receive assistance. <br/><br/>HUD claims that this proposed rule is a way to reduce poverty and address the waitlist crisis faced by Public Housing Authorities nationwide; I recognize that the proposed rule is a part of the current administrations coordinated attack on immigrant families.<br/><br/>This proposal would harm the U.S. Latino community and our nations future. Today, the Latino population is more than 55 million people, or roughly 18 percent of the total U.S. population. Despite their hard work and contributions to the economy, Latinos continue to struggle to find affordable housing. In 2017, 55 percent of Latinos who rented their home were cost-burdened  meaning 4.4 million Latinos spent a third or more of their income on rent. <br/><br/>Access to federal housing assistance has helped Latinos lift themselves out of poverty. According to an analysis by UnidosUS, federal housing assistance  including public and other subsidized housing  lifted approximately 800,000 Latinos out of poverty in 2017, including more than 280,000 Latino children. The proposed rule would deter many eligible Latinos from participating in public or subsidized housing programs and increase housing insecurity for Latino families. A recent analysis of HUDs administrative data estimates that 85 percent of households at risk of losing assistance under this proposed rule are Latino.  <br/><br/>I urge HUD to immediately withdraw its current proposal and dedicate its efforts to advancing policies that strengthenrather than underminethe ability of immigrants to support themselves and their families in the future. <br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rulemaking.

It also forces male children ages 18 and up to be separated from their mothers when in many instances the mother is the only family they have. This rule would force the breakup of families and deny assistance to those household members who would otherwise be eligible. It would also force elderly and/or disabled families into homelessness. <br/>On behalf of the families that I serve and have served every day for the past 22 years, I beg you to reconsider this cruel and heartless rule. <br/><br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

This rule, as proposed, is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million legal, documented U.S. citizens.

Further, in so doing, US citizens living in these houses will be evicted if the house has residents of mixed status. Evicting US citizens from shelter is an abomination. Additionally, based on the current track record of this administration's ability to provide temporary housing for immigrants at the border, I am not sure what will happen to the 25,000 families, including 55,000 children. Will the burden of their housing costs be borne by someone or are we, the richest country in the world, just simply going to boot them out to the street? Move them to one of the sub-human holding pens in Texas? What is the plan after evicting them? What is the standard of care that the United States is willing to provide to humans?

It leads to disease as was experienced in San Diego's two year fight against hepatitis A, which caused 20 deaths and over 590 infected people, many of whom had to have expensive in-hospital treatment.  The CDC was called and became involved.  To get the outbreak under control necessitated washing the feces off the streets, decontaminating them, and installing permanent toilets with handwashing facilities.  The homeless were vaccinated as well as those people who worked with them or came in contact with them, such a food workers.  This was national news and as such, San Diego took an economic beating in lost tourism as well as the approximately  12.5 million dollars spent on curbing the attack.  This was not the only outbreak.  Detroit suffered one of similar severity at the same time and other cities have experienced lesser events also. https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/cosd/SanDiegoHepatitisAOutbreak-2017-18-AfterActionReport.pdf <br/>Homelessness, like drug addiction, is an extremely deep hole to climb out of.  People suffer despair, turn to drugs and alcohol, and the 5 million or so children who are either citizens or legally in the United Stated will be affected by this proposed new change of removing any subsides for housing from blended families.  The childrens emotional well-being and the educational deficits resulting from their homelessness will lead to a new generation of marginalized citizens who will continue to need assistance from the government.<br/>San Diego is trying to combat homelessness by providing housing.  This is housing we are building at our cost for people who can, hopefully, transition to independence.  This entire cycle could be prevented if we allowed prorated public housing assistance to continue for all families whether or not one or more of the members is not a citizen or is not an eligible noncitizen.  Furthermore, many of these are extended families who share living quarters and if we enact this change we may be fast-tracking hundreds of thousands of families onto our streets who will need even more expensive public assistance.  <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

I know how important it is to get people into affordable homes quickly and I know what it means to see homelessness everywhere you go. I firmly believe that kicking people who are currently housed onto the streets solves nothing, and refusing to aid certain families on the pretext of making room for others only displaces those who already have homes, guaranteeing that those families will end up on someone else's waitlist (the waitlists of homelessness shelters, of other finanical support programs, etc.) making this logic inherently faulty.<br/><br/>We are all concerned about the fact that millions of people living in the U.S. struggle to keep roofs over their heads, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem, and displacing them only ensures that more privileged families will benefit at their direct expense. To implement such a policy is thus fundamentally immoral, shows that this administration is profoundly out of touch with the process of producing solutions that work in the real world, and works counter to everything that HUD is supposed to be trying to achieve. The real issue is the lack of funding available to ensure that every family, including all immigrant families, has access to one of the most basic of human rights: a safe place to call home. That issue will not be resolved by this policy or any other one like it, and thus this policy should not be implemented.<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this cruel and counterproductive proposed rule.

The proposed regulatory changes would require Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to deny program admission to, and terminate housing and rental assistance from, any household that includes any household member that does not have legal residency.  HUD has stated this is necessary in order to bring HUD regulations into greater alignment with Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, which prohibits HUD from making financial assistance available to persons other than legal residents.<br/><br/>Under current regulations, only eligible persons receive housing assistance, making the proposed rule completely un-necessary.

For example, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) has prioritized ending and preventing homelessness among families with children, regardless of immigration status. The proposed rule directly contradicts this policy goal by erecting additional barriers to housing access. Furthermore, the rule is in conflict with the National Affordable Housing Acts edict to ensure that every American family be able to afford a decent home in a suitable environment.<br/><br/>People who lose their housing due to the proposed rule will have a very challenging time time finding housing they can afford. In Illinois, there are just 35 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income renter households. Moreover, seventy-two percent of extremely low-income renter households are severely housing cost-burdened, spending more than half of their income on housing, with little left over for other basic necessities. This puts them on the brink, just one financial setback away from eviction and homelessness.<br/><br/>Although HUD acknowledges the potential costs of homelessness in their Regulatory Impact Analysis, noting that temporary and long-term homelessness is a likely for many families because of the proposed rule, it has not provided a detailed analysis of this economic impact.

After the US supported a deathsquad government in El Salvador for example, there was a civil war which devastated the country.

The homelessness that will result for entire families will create more barriers for children learning in school or even getting to school.  Parents will be handicapped in getting to their jobs and at real risk of losing them.  I live near a public housing project.  On my way to work each morning, I see the people waiting for the bus to come so they can go to work.  To put them on the street robs them of their dignity which comes from supporting their families.  It adds more strain to our social service and education system.  The economy in my county is based on tourism and agriculture.  This rule robs our local businesses of a needed labor force. This proposal is not only immoral but is not cost effective.  I urge HUD not to adopt it.<br/><br/>I am writing to say, I strongly oppose HUD's proposed "mixed-status" family rule. This rule is cruel and would cause great harm to over 100,000 people, including more than 55,000 children who are US citizens or have legal status. The supposed justification for this rule-reducing wait lists-has already been disproven by HUD's own analysis, proving there is no true purpose behind this rule, other than a desire to discriminate and cause harm.<br/><br/>Families belong together. In a time when families across our nation struggle to find affordable housing, causing a nationwide surge in families that are homeless will create endless problems and have an expansive, negative effect, far beyond the families directly impacted by this rule.<br/><br/>This cruel and unnecessary rule should be immediately withdrawn.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I think this proposed rule is both counter-productive and mean-spirited. As a clinical social worker, I am well aware that HUD-subsidized housing is scarce and that there is a waiting list. But the solution is to make more HUD-subsidized housing, not to threaten the stability of mixed-status families. This rule will make people homeless, plain and simple. It will make adults homeless, many of whom are working and paying sales taxes, because some of them will leave the homes they share with their families and have nowhere else to go. And it will make children homeless, because some of these families will not separate, either because they are unable to or because they cannot bear to. Our homeless shelters simply cannot meet the demand this rule will place upon them. In my area, there are only two shelters for men and one for women and children, and both of them are half an hour away by car. This rule will put an intolerable strain on the social safety net, and for what? So that families on the waiting list can get subsidized housing sooner? Move one family out, move another in? That will not save us any money, and there will still be a waiting list.<br/><br/>Separating families because some of them are undocumented is cruel, and this proposed rule follows the same course of thought as Homeland Security's disastrous "kids in cages" approach. Families separation is not the answer to immigration, immigration should not be HUD's job. Housing and Urban Development: that is a big enough job on its own without adding immigration status enforcement. <br/><br/>I recently heard an excellent story on This American Life about a small town in Tennessee where a workplace raid occurred. This town, where most people voted for Trump, saw the error of their ways when children were left behind by parents who were detained, parents who were working hard, not only at their jobs but also to raise their children. And the people of the town came together to raise tens of thousands of dollars to bail those parents out of jail. My point is that family separation may sound acceptable to you when you think about it abstractly, but when you can see it, that changes. Put yourself in the children's shoes, and imagine your own parent having to move out and possibly live on the streets because of their undocumented status. That is cruel and unusual punishment.<br/><br/>Please do not put this rule into effect. Undocumented immigrants are people, and they deserve to have their basic human needs met.

Our perspective is informed through interactions with our many base-building grassroots partners around the United States, who are committed to housing justice - housing as a human right by which all people are able to access high-quality, safe, and affordable housing. Among our network, housing justice is the second-most frequent social determinant of health for which our base-building partners are advocating and organizing. Our base-building partners work every day to keep families together by preserving, protecting and creating safe and affordable housing access. We are concerned that the proposed rule would diminish these efforts by separating families - or worse, putting children and others on the street.<br/><br/>Further, this rule is predicated on Executive Order 13828, Reducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility. The EO states that our country was founded on principles of freedom and equal opportunity towards self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility. Diminishing children and families access to a roof over their heads, separating families and evicting individuals and families all contradict these principles. <br/><br/>Housing stability for low-income residents is a vital social determinant of health and broader community economic stability. We already know that evictions are a health equity issue - increasing rates of evictions disproportionately impact Black women and their children. In addition, even the threat of eviction leads individuals to report poor health, high blood pressure, depression, anxiety and distress relative to people who experience stable housing. The results of evictions - including overcrowding, homelessness and emergency room visits - also demonstrate various negative health outcomes for adults and children.<br/><br/>Eviction and other forms of housing instability, such as having to move frequently, are particularly harmful for children, which means that these rule changes would harm the health of many children living in mixed-status families. Unstable housing means that children are more likely to have behavioral problems and to struggle in school  and in classrooms where the student population changes quickly and frequently, all students can fall behind. Education itself is linked to positive health outcomes and longer lives: thus, creating housing instability in childrens lives can have immediate and negative health impacts, but can also lead to poorer health across the lifecourse by disrupting their education.<br/><br/>When families have to put too much of their income towards their rent, they cannot afford to pay for other basic needs like food and health care. Hence, problems like food insecurity increase along with housing costs, and many renters delay needed medical care because they cant afford it.<br/><br/>Through its anticipated impact in terms of evictions, this proposal also violates basic just cause principles which have been codified by various cities and states - often as a result of concerted effort by housing justice advocates and partly in response to the fact that evictions have the greatest impact on low-income and Black residents.<br/><br/>Ripping families away from stable housing, or tearing families apart so that only some members can have a home while other do not, have severe and deadly public health outcomes - not just for the families, but for our society. We cannot have healthy, thriving communities by increasing separation and/or displacement and housing instability of low-income children and families. <br/><br/>For these reasons, I want to urge the Department to rescind this dangerous proposal which would leave families with no other choice but to either lose their homes or split up their family members. I ask that the Department instead promote policies that support access to high-quality, safe, and affordable housing as a human right.<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I oppose this proposal. Not only could it lead to the eviction of over 100,000 people, including 55,000 children, from HUD assisted housing. It would also tear families apart and leave 55,000 children homeless.  Furthermore, it's not even cost efficient! It would cost HUD tens of millions of dollars. As a person of conscience and a  public housing advocate, I oppose this attempt to instill fear and further disrupt the lives of hard working immigrant families. <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">HUD must answer why the thousands of American children who would be evicted under this rule are less worthy than the thousands of children who would go on to receive that same housing assistance. This rule would save no money, as any benefits taken from eligible citizens and noncitizens would simply be immediately reallocated to other people on waiting lists for housing aid. <br/><br/>HUD must also accurately account and answer for the inevitable harm it will invariably cause to all those displaced by the proposed rule. The RIA for this rule does not consider the effects of eviction on children specifically - effects on health, education, or future employment. See for example, a study published by Megan Sandel, Richard Sheward, Stephanie Ettinger de Cuba published in "Pediatrics" in 2018 - Unstable Housing and Caregiver and Child Health in Renter Families". This study found that children and caregivers who experience housing stability are at greater risk for adverse health consequences. Given that many people impacted by this proposed rule are likely enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid, adverse health impacts to them would directly affect the taxpayer. <br/><br/>HUD must also explain why it is not adopting any of the less disruptive, less costly alternatives suggested in HUD's own RIA. As it stands, this rule is costly and cruel for cruelty's sake, and should not be implemented.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development<br/><br/>I am writing to you regarding HUD's Proposed Mixed-Status Family Rule.

In current practice, federal funding is prorated only for eligible members, meaning that assistance is not going to those here illegally. Changing the program to make the entire household ineligible will displace an estimated 55,000 children here legally. As a pediatrician, I find it unconscionable to impose homelessness on US citizens in this way. Additionally, by HUD's own estimate, this will cost the program money through the process of evicting current residents and having to pay out more subsidies long term. This rule change is not the answer to our nation's affordable housing program.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to oppose this change in the rules that would no longer allow families into public housing if even one family member in the family is undocumented. Undocumented residents of public housing already do not receive the same subsidies as U.S. citizen residents, but allowing undocumented individuals into public housing is an essential policy in order to protect vulnerable children (often U.S. citizens themselves) and families from homelessness.<br/><br/>This proposed rule change would not only affect the individuals who are undocumented, but this discriminatory policy would also harm many legal residents and U.S. citizens who are part of mixed-status families. 108,000 people would likely lose access to housing, 76,000 of whom are legally eligible for benefits but would be unlikely to receive them due to their family connections with undocumented individuals.<br/><br/>Besides the likely homelessness of these tens of thousands of people, which is destructive for individuals and communities alike, this rule change would also cost HUD much more money in subsidies to legal residents in their housing. These increased subsidies are not sustainable in the current budgetary system, which means that more people would receive substandard housing caused by insufficient federal funds. So in fact, this rule change would make public housing available to FEWER people than currently, and harm both U.S. citizens and non-citizens in the process.

Those who live in the US without documentation are extra vulnerable, therefore undocumented families could use public housing even more so than poor citizens of the US.<br/><br/>Rather than making these rule changes to evict families without documentation, HUD should expand public housing funding.

This would not only burden the existing resources but would also place a burden on the taxpayers, shelter system and the emergency rooms. Homelessness is social determinant of health and plays a huge role in people being able to take care of their health. Many of my patients stop taking their medications when they become homeless because they do not have a reliable way to store and manage their medications. They also stop taking psychiatric medications (like antipsychotic and antidepressant medications) because they do not want to feel sedated when they are homeless and feel that they have to be awake to protect themselves from being attacked or robbed.

The impacts of family destabilization and separation, as well as homelessness, are well-studied and both could have and should have been incorporated in this proposed rule to provide a wholistic understanding of its intended impact. These impacts include: <br/><br/>(a) Impact on health care system: Regardless of affected individuals' payer status, the psychological stress of housing disruption, homelessness, and family separation will likely increase their prevalence of occult mental illness, exacerbate their control of chronic disease, and intensify their use of higher-cost health care delivery settings (e.g., emergency rooms, inpatient units) for both medical and social needs. It is likely that the bulk of the costs for these stays will be borne not by these individuals, but by the hospital systems that care for them (e.g., uncompensated care) and the cities and states in which they reside. Where affected individuals are legal residents, as 70% of persons in affected mixed-status families are estimated to be, many may be enrolled in Medicaid, with these health care costs borne by states and federal government. <br/><br/>(b) Impact on community safety, law enforcement,  criminal justice system: The administration has frequently voiced rhetoric drawing attention to certain groups of immigrant-based gangs, and their role in jeopardizing American safety. It is also well known that homelessness, particularly for adolescents and young adults, is associated with increased crime, including gang-based and organized crime. In addition, it is also well known that homeless women, including mothers, are more likely to enter the sex industry in order to provide temporary housing for themselves and their families. <br/><br/>Prior to finalizing this rule, the Department is responsible to the people of the United States to ensure that the American taxpayer is not inadvertently and unduly burdened by the downstream economic impact it creates on both our health care system and law enforcement/criminal justice system. In addition, the Department should directly, explicitly, and publicly accept the risks that this rule poses on American community safety, as specified in (b) above.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I oppose the plan to eliminate subsidies to families with mixed immigration status. <br/><br/>No individuals or families wod benefit, and HUD estimates that this change would cost the government as much as $227 million a year, money that Congress would need to appropriate.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am a licensed Social Worker and I have been working in the homelessness service provision field for over a decade.

I am horrified that HUD is seeking to pit families with mixed immigration statuses against families with non-mixed immigration.  HUD has continued to fail the poorest and most vulnerable families for decades and is now trying to scapegoat families with mixed immigration; it is nothing more than racism that the agency is now attempting to memorialize in this proposed rule change.  <br/><br/>As a hard-working tax-payer, I believe in the NECESSITY of public, low-income, affordable, and rent-regulated housing.  This country MUST maintain, improve, and BUILD MUCH MORE public, low-income, affordable, and rent-regulated housing in order to combat poverty, homelessness, ignorance, violence, and crime.

Undocumented immigrants are already barred from receiving federal housing assistance, but this rule would punish their citizen children and partners. It is yet another mean-spirited attack on poor people and immigrants from this administration. HUD's analysis estimates that 108,000 citizens or legal permanent residents, including c. 55,000 children, would be affected by this change. At the same time, HUD's own analysis concludes that the change would bring few benefits for other low-income families waiting for aid, and no benefits at all for the federal budget. In fact, the proposed rule would likely cost the government more (HUD estimates $227 million/year), since mixed families generally get lower subsidies and would likely be replaced with families who need higher subsidies. Without increased Congressional appropriations, the result would be a reduction in housing assistance overall. In other words, the proposed rule would harm the very low-income citizen families it is ostensibly designed to help. It is hypocritical as well as cruel. <br/><br/>In my volunteer work with asylum seekers, I work with a mixed-status family, a single mother in the asylum process with three young citizen children, one with special needs. They were homeless in Boston with winter approaching when we met them. We are trying to help this family apply for public housing assistance to keep them from ending up back on the street. This rule would put another roadblock in the way of a family that has already suffered persecution, domestic violence, and homelessness.

I believe this added verbiage would deter (non eligible immigration status) parents from using their childrens US citizenship as a way to take advantage of a system intended to help families who have legal citizenship (including nationals etc.). If benefits are intended for citizens, then why would an illegal parent be the leaseholder...prorated or not, that parent(s) is also benefitting from the system.  Thus reinforcing that you can continue to break the law and still reap the benefits of citizenship...at the expense of other families further down the waitlist.   There is always the argument that children will be left homeless, removed from their homes, etc.  Based on the article which linked this page, 55,000 children could be effected by this proposed change.  However, perhaps this change would encourage illegal parents to do the RIGHT thing and go through the process to become citizens, registered aliens, etc. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I oppose the HUD changes.

While HUD argues the proposed rule is needed to address long wait lists for housing assistance, HUD's own analysis shows that the proposed rule will result in fewer families receiving federal housing benefits.<br/><br/>Please do not target immigrant families who live in public housing or receive subsidies through HUD.  And please do not separate families.  HUD's proposed rule is cruel and inhumane to "mixed-status" families. <br/><br/>Millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis; however, HUD's blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

HUDs own analysis estimates that this proposed rule, if finalized, could result in the eviction of up to 55,000 US citizen children living in HUD-subsidized housing. This is cruel, unnecessary and unacceptable. <br/><br/>The current interpretation of Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 is a sensible one: that if an undocumented leaseholder in HUD housing has family members who are citizens or otherwise authorized then the family may continue to live in such housing, though the subsidy is prorated to reflect the ineligibility of assistance to undocumented individuals in the household. This proposed change simply seeks to severely punish impoverished families of mixed immigration status. In addition, we believe this change would cause a sharp increase in homelessness, as many of those evicted would lack the financial resources to lease other kinds of housing. Such homelessness would inevitably result in some children entering state child welfare systems which are already overwhelmed with children who are neglected and/or abused. It would also lead to adults relying more heavily on public services and welfare programs. In sum, the rule change would punish impoverished families of mixed immigration status, while increasing costs to the government for other social service programs.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs rule to prohibit mixed-status immigrant families from living in subsidized housing.

My father was taken from our home in 2004 while I was in school and soon after he was deported. I didn't have a chance to hug or say goodbye to him they just took him from his newborn baby, his wife and his 4 other children. I cannot imagine how much more strict they have become. My family suffered for years without all he did for us. I am asking you to please think about the children and how much you will effect their lives forever. Just think about you being in their position.

Instead this rule change will kick the curb children and spouses and break up families.  <br/>   Ben Carson and HUD should be ashamed of this policy which hurts families who are trying to help one another and improve their lives.<br/>  The Trump Administration has demonized, distorted and denigrated immigrants to our already great country, and yet they still want to come to live here and better their lives and contribute to our economy and society.<br/>  Mr. Trump's lies and baseless claims should not be the basis of any policy in regard to housing for immigrants regardless of their legal status.<br/>  Do not implement this change of housing rules and keep families together!</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">See attached file(s)</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

I personally assist a family that would result in a mother and her three citizen children becoming street homeless. This family spent years in a shelter, sleeping on a day room floor because Mom is a blind, non-citizen that does not speak English and has no way of working. She is blind due to not qualifying for insurance, and has diabetes that is out of control.

THis is unfair for elderly citizens. I am mental health clinician and I see low income elderly people everyday as patients and they can't get affordable housing or they cannot get into a senior apartment. Why? because there is a waiting list of like 10 years or more because of the illegal aliens or immigrants have taken all the affordable or low income apartments with their large family size. They are not allowing US citizens to be housed because illegal immigrants take all the affordable housing. This is not fair. This should not be.

We have immigrants in the United States who have had status but as a result of policy changes are losing status.  Temporary Protected Status is one example.<br/><br/>3.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>How does this rule conflict with Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-284, April 11, 1968)? This.  (Made it unlawful (1) to refuse to sell or rent or make unavailable or deny a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, or national origin, and (2) to discriminate against any person in the sale or rental. of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith because of race, color, religion, or national origin.  Made it unlawful for any bank, building and loan association, insurance company, or other corporation, association, firm or enterprise whose business consisted of making real estate loans to deny a loan or other financial assistance for the purchase, construction, improvement, repair or maintenance of a dwelling because of the race, color, religion, or national origin of the borrower , or persons with whom he was associated.   Made HUD responsible for administering the Fair Housing provisions.)<br/><br/>4.<span style="padding-left: 30px"></span>What will HUD do to mitigate the increase in homeless that will occur for mixed families of non-citizen and associated citizen family who would lose this assistance and be forced onto the streets? <br/><br/>Because of these concerns I urge you to withdraw these proposed rule changes.<br/><br/>I appreciate the opportunity to comment.  <br/><br/>Thank you very much,<br/><br/>Bob Zeigler<br/>1102 A.

Family unity is a fundamental American value and a cornerstone of our immigration system. The proposed rule is an attempt to sever these critical familial bonds, and it will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness.<br/><br/> The proposed rule threatens the health of children, and will effectively evict over 55,000 children who are eligible for the covered housing programs. The changes proposed are specifically designed to force families to make choices that will harm their childs health. Mixed status families will have to make the excruciating decision to either face eviction or separate as a family in order to retain housing stability. Both options will have lasting impacts on child and family health. Research shows that families who are evicted are more likely to experience homelessness, move into substandard or overcrowded housing, and have a sequence of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. The alternative, family separation, is a stressful and traumatizing experience for children, which can alter the architecture of a childs developing brain and have lifelong consequences.<br/><br/>Housing assistance also improves child healthchildren of families receiving housing assistance had a 35 percent higher chance of being labeled a well child, a 28 percent lower risk of being seriously underweight and a 19 percent lower risk of food insecurity. Access to affordable housing provides stability for families and frees up income for other necessities. Low-income households with children that pay more than half of their monthly income on rent spend considerably less on other basic necessitiesthey spend $200 less per month on food, nearly $100 less on transportation, and about $80 less on healthcare. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this proposed rule which is not only cruel, but contrary to our legacy as a nation that welcomes immigrants and promotes family togetherness as a core American value.<br/><br/>The wellbeing of children should NEVER be a partisan issue.

The health impacts of our society are at risk by threatening and reversing housing stability for mixed status families. Housing is the most important contributor to health and evicting or denying families housing, will have downstream effects on their health and add to our burdened health system. Living on the street or in homeless shelters exacerbates existing health problems and causes new ones. Chronic diseases, such as hypertension, asthma, diabetes, mental health problems and other ongoing conditions, are difficult to manage under stressful circumstances and may worsen. Acute problems such as infections, injuries, and pneumonia are difficult to heal when there is no place to rest and recuperate.<br/><br/>This is discrimination based on immigration status that not only targets undocumented individuals but their American family members. According to the Department's own analysis, 70% of the people affected by this rule change are citizens or legal residents and three-quarters of those 55,000 are children. It is imperative that we ensure that these children are healthy and empowered citizens rather than marginalized.<br/><br/>The cost to the taxpayer to implement this cruel and abhorrent rule change is unjustified and unfathomable. Like all other prospering countries, we should be investing in the stability and health of our communities rather than spending money to disrupt and introduce additional trauma to vulnerable communities. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Real concern and care for people with housing needs is what the U.S. needs.

I work as a housing case manager at a nonprofit agency called Transition Projects in Portland, OR. Although our agency serves a very diverse population, my role specifically is housing homeless veterans under the federal grant Supportive Services for Veteran Families(SSVF). There is a family in particular I have been working with for almost a year and a half now. The father is a young Army veteran that served overseas in Korea where he met his wife. They resettled here in Oregon where they now have 3 young children. The family struggled financially and were not able to afford to apply for a green card for his wife (I have connected them with a legal team to assist them but they still cannot afford the filing fees). The family recently received a HUD-VASH housing voucher and will move into their new home next month. Under HUD's proposed "Mixed-Status"rule, this young disabled veteran would have to move his family out of their home and struggle to find fair-market housing amidst Portland's current housing crisis just because of the immigration status of his wife and mother of his children?<br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this proposed rule which is not only cruel, but contrary to our legacy as a nation that welcomes immigrants and promotes family togetherness as a core American value.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

My parents came from modest means and were able to provide our small but growing family with a safe, affordable place to call home.

Don't punish these people because they are poor....they could become the drivers of the new economy, the innovators of tomorrow and the lifeblood of our future.  <br/> <br/>We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem.

According to the Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation, approximately 1.6 million families are looking for subsidized housing. Freeing up about 25,000 units will do little to reduce HUD waiting lists.<br/>According to HUD data, over half of the persons living in mixed-status families are U.S. citizen children under the age of 17. These children are at risk of losing their homes.<br/>Not all ineligible household members are undocumented. They could be ineligible for subsidized housing for other reasons.<br/>This rule change would put additional strains on local housing authorities. Removing a family is not cost-free. It entails administrative staff time and legal resources. These local housing authorities are already overburdened.<br/>Fear of family separation could prompt mixed-status families to vacate pubic or subsidized housing whether or not the fear is justified.<br/>If the Trump administration was serious about addressing the housing crisis in the U.S. today, they would not have slashed funding for affordable housing in their FY 2020 HUD budget request.<br/>This rule change seems to be rooted in the strong anti-immigrant stance that is a hallmark of this administration rather than in a genuine concern for the housing needs of low-income individuals and families.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule to prohibit mixed status families from living in subsidized housing. <br/><br/>This is simply cruel and serves no legitimate, constructive policy purpose.

The proposed rule is an attempt to sever these critical familial bonds, and it will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness.<br/><br/>Working with mixed families for over the past 10 years, I have seen how vital it is for these families to have access to subsidized housing to be able to make sure US Citizens and children are able to have their basic needs met.  This has allowed mothers the ability to leave abusive relationships and provide a better life for their children.<br/> <br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this proposed rule which is not only cruel, but contrary to our legacy as a nation that welcomes immigrants and promotes family togetherness as a core American value.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I agree with this action.

The rule will result in over 55,000 children being evicted from their homes, and it would be harmful to childrens development and have implications for their well-being into adulthood. It would also increase the number of children living in poverty each year. <br/><br/>I work with immigrant survivors of domestic violence. If this rule change goes into effect, many families that I work with will be homeless. This includes U.S citizen children of immigrant survivors who are survivors of domestic violence themselves. Often these families are on a fixed income because the survivor is unable to work to afford market rate rent due to their experiences of trauma, disability, or they are unable to obtain work status because of our immigration laws. Without access to safe, stable housing these survivors and their children will be unable to recover from their trauma and heal and grow, and are likely to continue to be victimized if they are left homeless.<br/><br/>This rule change would also close off a key resource for undocumented survivors who want to leave their abusive relationship. Without being able to access a housing subsidy, many immigrant survivors and their U.S citizen children will be left with no choice but to stay in a harmful situation with their abuser. This has generational repercussions that will continue to affect the U.S population for decades.<br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development. Experiencing the stress of housing instability is harmful to young childrens development. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw its current proposal.

Since 2017, HUD has undercut the funding for public housing authorities, and seems intent on eliminating a safety net for the elderly, the disabled, and the needy.<br/><br/>The HUD proposed rule to remove undocumented immigrants and, at worst, their entire families from subsidized housing is an unfunded mandate on local housing providers and will result in families being evicted. Housing authorities already do NOT provide any subsidies to ineligible family members. This rule will force housing authorities to divert extremely limited resources from providing shelter to children, seniors, veterans, and families to an unnecessary administrative process, and will result in fewer eligible families receiving assistance. Forcing thousands of immigrant families to make the unconscionable decision to either break up their family to receive housing assistance, or forgo housing assistance altogether will not fix the nations housing crisis.  Evictions from subsidized housing result in greater numbers of homelessness.  <br/><br/>The implementation of this proposed rule will not result in any savings to HUD, and only increase the number of disadvantaged households.

It will cause enormous hardship, overburden the nonprofits that must pick up the pieces when families lose housing, and instead of accomplishing federal savings or law enforcement advantages it will additionally burden state and federal governments who will need to provide costly emergency housing for family members who do qualify for federal housing assistance. <br/><br/>Please withdraw support from this proposal and put your energy toward genuine immigration reform.<br/><br/>Cristina Hutchison</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This is nothing more than a deceitful way to put brown people on the streets and hope that they will leave the country.

Evictions alone would cost HUD $3-4 million. Newly homeless families will rise  costing $20,000 to $50,000 per individual per year. It would create higher costs to assistance for non-mixed status families who statistically require more aide than mixed status families, resulting in a likely reduction of quantity and quality of assisted housing overall.<br/><br/>In sum, this proposed rule is contrary to HUD's mandate to affirmatively further fair housing and is an attack on American citizen children and tax paying families in need of such housing.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs rule to prohibit mixed-status immigrant families from living in subsidized housing.

I strongly oppose this rule, not only because it would have an unfair impact on children who are U.S. citizens living in mixed-status households, but also because it would actually exacerbate the very problem it purports to help solve: the ongoing housing crisis.<br/><br/>As a university student, the issue of affordable housing is particularly important to me. Many of my fellow students come from families that have sought or are seeking housing assistance. I am very concerned about the proposed rule because it would affect students like those that I study alongside, as well as much younger students. Nearly all of the children in mixed status families who are receiving HUD assistance are U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents; it is usually another adult in their household who is ineligible for housing assistance because of their immigration status. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 already accounts for these ineligible adults by decreasing the housing subsidy for the household to account for family members who are ineligible. <br/><br/>By prohibiting mixed-status families from receiving housing assistance, HUDs proposed rule will negatively and unfairly affect the lives of students who are U.S. citizens and who are therefore eligible for assistance. Under the proposed rule, 55,000 children would be displaced from their homes, and would become at-risk of homelessness. Tens of thousands of these children are students who are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. After losing their homes, the probability that these children will complete their studies and go on to employment and financial independence will be dramatically lowered. In this way, the proposed rule will end up hurting some of the most vulnerable U.S. citizens.<br/><br/>In addition to having a damaging impact on students who are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, the proposed rule would fail to achieve its purported goal of shortening the waiting list for U.S. citizens who are seeking subsidized housing; in fact, it would worsen the current housing crisis. HUD has acknowledged that the proposed rule will likely lead to a decrease in the number of assisted families. Replacing mixed-status families with households comprised entirely of eligible members would cost HUD from $372 million to $437 million annually, and HUD would have to reduce the quantity and quality of assisted housing in order to adjust to these higher costs. <br/><br/>The examples I have discussed above are only a couple of the many ways in which prohibiting mixed-status families from receiving housing assistance will not only fail to alleviate the housing crisis, but will also be harmful to our country's families, communities, and economy. Before implementing any rule that determines which immigrant families are eligible or ineligible for subsidized housing, HUD needs to perform a comprehensive study on the impact that its policies would have. This is the only way that it will be possible to find an effective solution to the housing crisis that will not hurt U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. I urge that the current proposed rule be withdrawn in its entirety, and that HUDs long-standing regulations remain in effect as the Department seeks more effective and humane ways to address the housing crisis. <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to consider my comment.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">This proposed change WILL harm thousands of children.

They are human beings who deserve to be treated with dignity--and that includes prioritizing keeping their families intact. <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class=""> I am very disturbed by the proposed regulation on public housing and immigration status. <br/><br/>Over my lifetime I have known a great number of families who are "mixed"--some citizens, some immigrants or going through various stages of the immigration process. The idea of kicking out "mixed" families--or separating families, if the families decide the only way they can make it with a roof over their head is to live apart--is terrible. It is even more terrible when done at the behest of my government.<br/><br/>Logically this makes no sense, as rental payments/benefits are prorated. The ineligible family member(s) gets no rental subsidy. Because immigration status is currently taken into account and factored into the family share of the rent, I can conceive of no reasonable explanation for such a regulation. Under the proposed regulation that ineligible family member--whether a small child, adult, or elderly person--will know that the entire family will be made homeless because of the individual's immigration status. <br/><br/>Is this supposed to be some back door way to cut the housing budget under the guise of kicking out residents who get no benefits from the system, as fewer eligible persons will be getting subsidies? Or is this simply a mean-spirited regulatory means to increase homelessness among children?</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing on behalf of Vista Community Clinic (VCC) in response to the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) proposed rule to express our strong opposition to the changes regarding "verification of eligible status, published in the Federal Register on May 10, 2019 (RIN 2501-AD89; HUD Docket No. FR-6124-P-01).  Many of VCCs patients will be impacted negatively by these changes which in turn will impact health outcomes in this population.  We urge the rule to be withdrawn in its entirety, and that HUDs long-standing regulations remain in effect.<br/>VCC serves over 68,000 patients annually, the majority of whom fall below the federal poverty line.  Affordable housing is the only way many of these patients can avoid homelessness.  VCC is well aware that homelessness is a social determinant of health and has adverse outcomes on health.<br/>Although HUD contends that the proposed rule is a means of addressing the waitlist crisis faced by a majority of Public Housing Authorities nationwide, VCC recognizes that the proposed rule is a part of the current administrations coordinated attack on immigrant families. We all share the concern that millions of U.S. households struggle to find affordable housing in the ongoing nationwide housing crisis, but blaming struggling immigrant families will not fix this problem. Indeed, HUDs own analysis of the proposed rule concludes that fewer, not more, families are likely to receive assistance as a result of the rule. The real issue is the lack of sufficient funding to ensure that every family, regardless of immigration status, has access to one of the most basic of human rightsa safe place to call home. <br/>The proposed rule will hurt tens of thousands of immigrant families, including many citizen children.  As a pediatrician this is particularly concerning to me.  This rule jeopardizes their family and housing stability, both of which are critical to getting families on a pathway to self-sufficiency and better life and health outcomes.<br/>The rule would force mixed status families to make an impossible decisioneither break up to allow eligible family members to continue receiving assistance or forgo the subsidies so that the families can stay together. Family separations undermine family stability, and leads to toxic stress, trauma, and attachment issues in children. Even a temporary separation has an enormous negative impact on the health and educational attainment of these children later in life, and many parents struggle to restore the parent-child bond once it has been disrupted by a separation. However, since 70% of mixed status families currently receiving HUD assistance are composed of eligible children and at least one ineligible parent, it is likely that these families will forgo the subsidies to avoid separation, resulting in homelessness, which is also considered an adverse childhood event leading to negative health outcomes over a lifetime. <br/>While it is clear that the proposed rule is a direct attack on immigrants and citizens in mixed status households, these families are not the only group that will be harmed if the rule is finalized. In addition to attacking mixed status families, the proposed rule creates red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million U.S. citizens currently receiving HUD assistance and all future U.S. citizens seeking these benefits.  The rule also requires that proof of citizenship be provided.  For those who are unable to produce the required documents within the required time period under the proposed HUD rule, they will lose their housing assistance, and many will be evicted from their homes.  A significant share could become homeless.<br/>The proposed rule runs counter to U.S. policy priorities on preventing and responding to homelessness and poverty.  For this reason and the others outlined above, we urge HUD to immediately withdraw its current proposal, and dedicate its efforts to advancing policies that strengthenrather than underminethe ability of immigrants to support themselves and their families in the future. If we want our communities to thrive, everyone in those communities must be able to stay together and get the care, services and support they need to remain healthy and productive.<br/>Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed rulemaking.

The NRPM is a welcome step towards ensuring that HUD remains a careful steward of the taxpayer fisc, ensuring that all expenditures are authorized by Congress, consistent with all applicable laws.  Nevertheless, (1) several additions could be made to strengthen the proposed rule, and (2) the economic analysis could be improved by disaggregating portions of the value characterized as transfers in subsidies from ineligible mixed households to eligible non-mixed households (estimated in the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) at $179 million to $210 million per year) as cost savings.  In particular, some portion of subsidy to current beneficiaries in mixed households is to ineligible members, which the RIA notes are likely to be illegal residents. <br/><br/>Given the agency determination of ineligible members of mixed households receiving assistance (31,811) and the average subsidy of $1,900, this amount is likely $60.4 million (unless, for example, the agency estimates that ineligible members receive higher or lower-than-average benefits by, for example, appearing at disproportionate rates in households with higher incomes or in areas with higher rents. This subsidy is pure loss, as it is a subsidy unauthorized by statute.

It will jeopardize housing for 25,000 mixed-status immigrant families and therefore for thousands of U.S. citizens, many of them children, and is plainly just another attempt at family separation, an inhumane practice that is beneath contempt.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, more than 95% of whom U.S. citizens.  Its proposed documentation requirements would in all probability be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people in general to satisfy even when they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.  It also discriminates against women: the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance are women and girls; owing to systemic barriers to economic security, this is likely to remain true for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>HUD should be working with Congress to secure the funding to ensure that MORE families have affordable and accessible housing, not confronting families with the choice of separating or losing their homes.  Though more subtle, this proposed rule is of a piece with the barbarous concentration camps on our southern border.  It needs to be withdrawn immediately.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Brian M.

Family unity is a fundamental American value and a cornerstone of our immigration system. The proposed rule is an attempt to sever these critical familial bonds, and it will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness.<br/><br/>Working in emergency housing navigation, I can say for sure that this proposal will cost the government more money than you will save. People will become homeless and cut off from the resource of their family. This will put a higher burden on shelters and other government funded resources to care for people who were already housed. Our housing system is overburdened and underfunded already, and this will do nothing to improve that. Housing is a human right. Families that are able to have housing are able to contribute to the rest of society. Without housing it is next to impossible to get a job, volunteer, buy and prepare food, and take care of one's physical and mental health. Don't go down in history as the administration that caused the housing and healthcare systems to be overburdened by people who were housed and are now needlessly homeless. Be the administration that gives people a chance to build connections, feel safe and secure, and sleep indoors at night. <br/><br/>Beyond this, I work with many people who were born in their home town, currently living in their home town, and don't have proof of citizenship. When you don't have extra money, time or resource to spare, it is incredibly hard to get documentation of citizenship. Without money for a birth certificate, you can't get a social security card. Without a social or birth certificate, one cannot get an ID. Without an ID, one cannot get a social security card. People will needlessly lose their housing because they are not able to provide documentation that they are citizens. In fact, at least 12% of people who make under $25,000/ year do not have citizenship documentation, and you will do a disservice to the people you are meant to help by forcing people out of stable housing for the sake of a document. Entire communities will feel the impact of what you do with this proposed rule. You want to target the most vulnerable among us, and will be doing just that, but it will not only affect the people you want to target in your heartless race war. <br/><br/>The Trump Administration should immediately withdraw this proposed rule which is not only cruel, but contrary to our legacy as a nation that welcomes immigrants and promotes family togetherness as a core American value.</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs rule to prohibit mixed-status immigrant families from living in subsidized housing.

It would also increase the number of children living in poverty each year. <br/><br/>I went to college at Community College of Denver, where I heard the stories of countless of my classmates impacted by cruel immigration tactics. I attended classes with straight-A students who were studying to become teachers, social workers, nurses and other essential members of the community who had come home to find their parents gone, and saw the strain that seperating families created for these students- now acting as parents to their younger siblings as well as trying to achieve their dreams. I saw students who came to the United States as infants who were now excelling and studying and trying to join the workforce, who had great plans for what our country could be. <br/><br/>Colorado faces an affordable housing crisis right now, much like the rest of the country. In Denver, gentrification is pushing prior homeowners out of their homes, and with them, extended family members, people with children or elderly parents who are now relying on HUD benefits to give them shelter. Our homelessness crisis is already damaging the city of Denver, is already costing taxpayers so much-- why would we ever introduce something like this to productive members of society, and make the problem worse?<br/><br/>Like all children, children in mixed-status immigrant families benefit when they have access to programs and services that help meet their basic needs and promote their development.

There are federal regulations that already prohibit undocumented immigrants from receiving federal assistance. And you know the numbers: a total cost of $227 million per year. Evictions alone would cost HUD $3-4 million. Newly homeless families will rise  costing $20,000 to $50,000 per individual per year. It would create higher costs to assistance for non-mixed status families who statistically require more aide than mixed status families, resulting in a likely reduction of quantity and quality of assisted housing overall.<br/> <br/>Helping citizens is an unsubstantiated pretextual reason to justify the real motive here  separating families and terrorizing immigrant communities.

This is not about undocumented immigrants. This rule could impact naturalized citizens who are unable to provide original documents, and other noncitizens who did enter the US legally and/or obtain their status lawfully. Although some "noncitizens with eligible immigration status" may continue to receive housing subsidies, there are many noncitizens who are ineligible for federal assistance programs - yet at the same time - are not undocumented (i.e. asylum-seekers, refugees, U-Visa holders, those with pending status, etc.). In addition, this new rule eliminates "mixed families" in which one household member is eligible for services, but other household members, regardless of age or disability, are not. <br/><br/>The ramification of this proposed rule could result in not only thousands of families being torn apart, but also thousands of vulnerable children and older adults becoming homeless. Homelessness is traumatic, decreases life expectancy, and in this case, is preventable.

We, as a nation, need to be working together to keep ALL families safe and give everyone the opportunity strive in our communities. I believe this does nothing to advance the fair housing act and instead is doing the exact opposite by not giving everyone the right to fair housing. We need to be keeping families together and give them opportunities to have safe, decent affordable housing, not break them apart. Everyone should have the right to affordable housing and I believe forcing families to breakup to receive assistance or forego assistance altogether would be moving in the wrong direction. Family unity is a fundamental American value and a cornerstone of our immigration system. The proposed rule is an attempt to sever these critical familial bonds, and it will force many families choose between being torn apart and homelessness. Compared to U.S. citizens, immigrant families are more likely to have higher housing costs and are more likely to face housing cost burdens. By enacting this proposed rule, finding housing would be even more difficult for them and would increase their barrier to having a safe, decent affordable place to call home. We should be increasing access to affordable housing, and decreasing the hardship of paying for affordable housing by offering rental assistance to ALL families, if someone in the household qualifies for assistance.  When families have to put too much of their income towards their rent, they cant afford to pay for other basic needs like food and health care. No one should have to choose between paying rent or feeding their family that week. In addition, children are our future; by giving them opportunities to thrive and meet their basic needs of shelter, they are on track to being successful and doing big things in their futures. By eliminating the ability of mixed status families to receive prorated assistance on a permanent basis, the proposed rule robs eligible children of housing subsidies because they have parents with ineligible non-citizen status. The proposed rule would also make it impossible for many inter-generational families to live together and share resources that enable them to succeed. It ignores the critical roles many grandparents play in caring for their grandchildren and other family members, as well as the role adult children play in caring for their aging parents and relatives..<br/><br/>We urge HUD to immediately withdraw its current proposal, and dedicate its efforts to advancing policies that strengthenrather than underminethe ability of immigrants to support themselves and their families in the future. If we want our communities to thrive, everyone in those communities must be able to stay together and get the care, services and support they need to remain healthy and productive.<br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

The Department of Housing and Urban Developments own impact analysis estimates that putting it into effect would cost between $12 to $17 million.  If mixed status immigrant households leave the public housing and supportive housing programs, HUD will have to spend over an extra $200 million extra dollars a year on new stipends.  <br/><br/>By HUDs own analysis, most (70%) of the tenants who would be affected by the rule are US citizens.  The rule is discriminatory, in that it effectively penalizes citizens for having immigrant relatives.   <br/><br/>This rule would punish children.

The resulting housing instability and homelessness this rule would cause would have long-term ill effects on those childrens long-term physical, psychological, educational growth and futures.

And opposed to proposed rule: Verification of eligibility status under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Because said proposed rule would negatively affect residents in the following manner, it will be forcing numerous residents out of their homes causing for more homeless issues around LA. The residents within the community do not earn as much money to pay rent elsewhere; they rely on the government assistance. As well, it will affect the childrens lives within these families; they will no longer be eligible for the programs within the community. The public housing provides summer jobs, job search assistance, and resume assistance. So, removing the child from the opportunities limits them to succeed.  <br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">If it goes into effect, this rule will mean that over 11,000 New Yorkers could lose their housing assistance.

It will cost more money for both administration and later support services for homeless individuals. It will increase psychological health problems in both adults and children affected, severely impacting their long-term health and success in American society, and further adding to public health costs. The benefits to other families are, in HUD's own analysis, going to be minimal. <br/><br/>It is clear that this is primarily a punitive measure, intended to send a political message at the cost of both tax dollars and human suffering. And the impact of these kinds of evictions cannot be reversed later. Family separations, housing uncertainty, homelessness and eviction leave permanent scars on children, even if their access to housing is later restored. Please read and pay attention to the detailed analysis by HUD staffers, and remember that the mission of HUD is to reduce suffering of poor Americans, particularly children, not to act as a punitive arm of immigration policy against its own best interests.

Many individuals that live in this country are not U.S. citizens, and denying these individuals the right to receive housing benefits is indicative of the racism that we have seen coming from the executive branch. Non-U.S. citizens in this country are actually beneficial to our economy as they frequently pay their taxes and significantly bolster local economies. They also commit far less crimes than actual citizens. By providing housing assistance to these individuals, that would allow them to contribute further to the economy as they would have increased spending funds.<br/><br/>For these reasons and many others, I demand that the Department of Housing and Urban Development rescind this proposal and actually give assistance to those who need it, especially People of Color and those without U.S. citizenry.<br/><br/>Kyle Gould </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">Housing agencies abide by current HUD rules which prohibit the provision of financial assistance to ineligible individuals. Neither undocumented immigrants nor documented immigrants without required eligibility status receive subsidies from housing authorities.<br/><br/>The current rules are in full compliance with the law, which states that financial assistance to mixed families must be prorated. Current law does not prohibit ineligible non-citizens from residing in assisted households.  The current rules around subsidy pro-ration have been in place for more than 20 years, and work effectively. There is no data to support the idea that ineligible non-citizens are receiving assistance.<br/><br/>It is not practical to expect local judges in some states to support housing authorities attempting to evict families to comply with this federal rule when the families have not violated their lease.  Evicting families pursuant to the rule will cost local agencies significantly (HUD estimates between $3.3 and $4.4 million). As HUD is not providing funds for legal action and housing authorities have long been suffering under deeply prorated operating expense funding from Congress, this additional financial burden will make it harder to serve families and operate assistance programs effectively.<br/><br/>Mixed families have been admitted into housing programs according to the rules that HUD has promulgated. To now subject families to termination because of a reinterpretation of law is unacceptable.  The proposed rule suddenly makes families ineligible through no fault of their own. Moving the goalposts in this manner reflects a capricious method of policy making that is not consistent with a Department that seeks to administer Federal programs in a fair and just manner.  This regulation will force thousands of households including 55,000 children into housing insecurity which is anathema to the stated goals of both HUD and housing authorities.  HUD previously stated that the current rule strives to maintain the unity of the family, but the Departments new interpretation, as characterized by Secretary Carson, counts residency in a subsidized unit, even with a prorated subsidy, as a benefit in and of itself. This punitive action will not maintain the unity of affected families.  Secretary Carson has said that the families on waiting lists deserve housing assistance and will benefit from this rule. Pitting needy mixed families against needy families on HA waiting lists is harsh and inappropriate.<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing in strong opposition to this proposed rule. The rule purports prevent individuals without legal residency from receiving federally subsidized housing. This problem does not exist. Current regulations provide lower assistance levels for each member of a family who may not have legal status - meaning, currently, federal assistance only reaches individuals with legal status.<br/><br/>I work in supportive housing in Los Angeles, California where I direct programs assisting chronically homeless individuals obtain and maintain independent housing. <br/><br/>The implementation of the rule as proposed will force families to make a choice - stay together and lose stable housing or separate. Considering most families affected by the proposed rule will have Hispanic ethnicities, the proposed rule may violate fair housing and anti-discrimination laws. This rule also echos the choice given to Mexican citizens at the end of the Mexican-American War, when Mexican citizens who lived in what the treaty now enforces as the United States had to leave their land and homes to retain Mexican citizenship within one year of the treaty's approval.<br/><br/>The proposed rule is a continuation of providing privileges to white families while disadvantaging families of color. It will have detrimental effects on thousands of families, increase homelessness, and be used further to justify violence and discrimination against climate refugees and asylum seekers. The proposed rule manufactures a problem from thin air to justify discrimination against people of color and will create barriers for those seeking assistance, increasing their vulnerability to exposure and violence.<br/><br/>If HUD's goal is to reduce waiting list times and increase the number of families receiving housing assistance, HUD would be better served by seeking increased funding from Congress to increase the number of subsidies available. Only twenty-five percent of families who qualify for housing assistance receive it - not because of mixed-status families - but because of the planned scarcity of assistance. Housing is a universal human right; this rule rejects that truth in the service of intentionally discriminatory action.<br/><br/></div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

The intentional creation of homelessness, whether for citizens or non-citizens puts an enormous financial burden on communities and state and local governments. Homelessness is not cheap. Subsidizing housing is by far the most cost effective way to reduce the municipal cost of homelessness. The Coalition for the Homeless notes that "Federal housing programs are one of the most successful housing-based solutions to reduce homelessness." An increase in homeless families in a town or city has a terrible financial impact, from the cost of shelter beds, food needs, emergency care, and more. <br/><br/>Even if it were the case that this proposed rule would save money or discourage immigration or stimulate productivitynone of which it will doit would still be wildly unethical to intentionally make tens of thousands of children homeless. Not to mention sabotaging families who are currently productive members of society because their basic needs are met. <br/><br/>Please reconsider this rule. It's cruel. It's ineffective. It will do far more harm than good not only for the families impacted, but for the cities and towns in America that already struggle with the costs and effects of homelessness. </div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I am writing to strongly oppose HUDs proposed rule that could cause more than 100,000 people to be evicted from their homes, including more than 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or have legal status.

Creating this impossible choice for families is wrong, especially when the federal subsidy already excludes support for ineligible household members. The effect of this rule is that HUD denies housing to those tenants who are citizens or whose status makes them eligible for housing, but who cannot disrupt their families in response to a rule change.<br/>Requiring all federally subsidized tenants and program applicants to provide proof of their citizenship or immigrant status is also contrary to the Amherst Housing Authority's mission.  Producing all the required documentation is an additional burden for low income people, many of whom are elderly or disabled. Requiring documentation for every family member when the family applies for housing can suppress the number of people who successfully apply.  This revision is needlessly punitive and will be an administrative and financial burden for housing authority staff.<br/>The proposed amendments to Section 214 do not ameliorate the affordable housing crisis in the United States.

I respectfully submit these comments as the data manager at the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration (CSII) at the University of Southern California. <br/><br/>The proposed change will affect a large proportion of immigrants and their loved ones all over the nation. The change will likely effect immigrants of all statuses and the U.S. citizens with whom they live. As a resident of Los Angeles County, a change in the eligibility requirements for assisted housing programs is especially important to the community I live in. In fact, 3.6 million people36 percent of Los Angelenosare foreign born, and 58 percent of all children under 18 in LA County have at least one immigrant parent. Los Angeles is also home to many mixed-status families, whose lives should be taken into account. Of all LA County families, 16 percent are composed of at least one undocumented family member and another member that is a legal permanent resident or citizen. These numbers are from a December 2018 report by our researchers at Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration (and can be found in the attachment to this comment). <br/><br/>The danger of a policy change like the one proposed is that it also has the power to affect public health and safety for everyone in our communities. For example, an anti-immigrant policy such as this is likely to create fear among these populations and cause people to keep their families away from government agencies, and services for fear of jeopardizing themselves and revealing their status. This fear could prevent individuals from accessing assisted housing programs, jeopardizing family and housing stability, and placing families at risk of homelessness. Allowing immigrant communities safe and secure access to housing will enable them to participate and contribute to their families. <br/><br/>With approximately nine percent of Americas immigrants living in Los Angeles County, I have a special interest in this issue. LA County leaders recognize that providing opportunities, encouraging civic engagement, and being open to immigrants and all members of our communities, means healthier and safer communities for all. Communities across the country stand to benefit a great deal from having stable, thriving, and active immigrant community members more fully integrated into social and economic life. A shift in the eligibility requirements of these assisted housing programs as proposed by this rule will complicate immigrant integration efforts  and it will reaffirm exclusion and difference at a time when inclusive and common ground are key. The concerns about rule changes raised by immigrant advocates, local leaders, and housing experts in Los Angeles and around the country are well founded, and should be given due consideration in the debates ahead.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Justin Scoggins</div> <div class="hidden"> <i>No documents available.</i> </div> </div>, <div class="GIY1LSJIXD"> <div class="clearfix hidden"> <div class="floatLeft" style="margin-top:10px">View document:</div> <div class="GIY1LSJJXD floatLeft"></div> </div> <div class="">I do not support this rule change.

This proposed change unjustly punishes mixed status immigrant families that are only exercising their ability access subsidized housing under current federal law. <br/><br/>Under the proposed new requirements for documentation, tens of thousands of public housing agencies and private property owners and managers would need to collect documents proving the citizenship of over nine million assisted residents receiving HUD assistance who have already attested, under penalty of perjury, as well as the citizenship of future applicants for assistance. Housing providers would also need to collect status documentation from 120,000 elderly immigrants.<br/><br/>Additionally, the proposed rule calls for public housing authorities to establish their own policies and criteria to determine whether a family should receive continued or temporary deferral of assistance. All of these requirements will place a significant cost burden on housing authorities and other subsidized housing providers that are completely unaccounted for in the rule.<br/><br/>Other anticipated costs for housing authorities and other subsidized housing providers include:<br/><br/>--Formally evicting and terminating the assistance of thousands of mixed status families that HUD estimates would be $4.4 million.<br/><br/>--Unit turnovers because of the chilling effect of this rule on eligible immigrant families who will forgo housing assistance.<br/><br/>--Fielding questions from tenants fearful about the implications of the proposed rule on their families. Housing providers will have to be prepared to answer consumer questions about the new rule. They will experience increased call volume and traffic from tenants and applicants about the new policies.<br/><br/>--Updating forms and notices to ensure that they are providing tenants and applicants with accurate information about the potential consequences of receiving certain housing assistance.<br/><br/>Again, many of these costs and burdens on housing providers are not considered in the proposed rule. Moreover, these costs could deter housing providers from participating or continuing to participate in these programs, which would decrease the affordable housing supply even more. <br/><br/>The proposed rule will require already overburdened public housing authorities and housing providers to take on additional administrative costs, without providing the benefit of reducing waitlists or improving public housing. <br/><br/>HUD has failed to account for these costs and should do its due diligence and perform a comprehensive study on the impact the proposed rule will have on housing providers and local housing markets more generally, before finalizing the proposed rule.<br/><br/>I ask that the proposed rule be immediately withdrawn. Family unity should be considered a fundamental value and component of our immigration system.

This is yet another attempt at family separation and would undermine the values that immigrant and non-immigrant families in this country all share.<br/><br/>It is also alarming that this proposed rule would create burdensome red tape that threatens housing security for 9.5 million people currently receiving HUD assistance, which includes 9.1 million U.S. citizens. Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>The wealthy and amoral 1% who seem to be a bunch of crooks like the President should be put in jail for being selfish and amoral and without compassion as you are.

Women and girls comprise the majority of people currently receiving HUD assistance and, because of systemic barriers to economic security, are likely to be the majority of applicants in the future too. This rules proposed documentation requirements would likely be extremely difficult for people over the age of 50, people of color, people with disabilities, and low-income people more generally to satisfy even if they are still eligible to receive housing assistance.<br/><br/>HUD should work with Congress to secure the funding to ensure more families have affordable and accessible housing.

Because we were born and raised here, we were able to find shelter in an Housing Project in Venice Beach, California. The simple fact that we had a roof over our head and could focus on getting our education while our single mother no longer had to work three jobs to afford rent, we were able to accomplish so much in life. Now, more than six years later, after attaining our undergraduate education, I can now focus on giving back to other communities like the one I grew up in.

By taking away the homes of people with mixed status, you are unstabalizing an entire economy and future generations. These are families that have established homes and are incorporated in every part of our economy and daily life. We say we care abut children, turning our back on family members without legal status is turning our back on US citizen children too.

(POAH) strongly opposes the changes to HUDs regulations outlined in the proposed rule referenced above.<br/><br/>The proposed rule would cause the displacement of an estimated 25,000 mixed-status families from HUD-assisted housing, including (by HUDs estimation) more than 55,000 children, all of whom are legal U.S. residents or citizens.  <br/><br/>The proposal would also threaten housing assistance for millions of households that remain eligible for assistance and consist only of U.S. citizens or eligible immigrants. It would require tens of thousands of housing agencies and private property owners to collect documents proving the citizenship of more than 9 million assisted residents who have already attested, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens, as well as the citizenship of future applicants for assistance. If individuals are unable to produce these documents in the timeframe permitted, they can lose their housing assistance and, in turn, their homes.<br/><br/>The proposed rule will not save money, because HUD does not currently subsidize housing for people who are ineligible for subsidy based on their citizenship status; assisted households subsidy is pro-rated for the share of eligible household members.  In fact, because subsidy to mixed-status households is pro-rated, displacing such households in favor of households with uniform eligibility will actually increase HUDs subsidy cost per unit, on average, as HUDs own regulatory impact analysis confirms.<br/><br/>Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments.
